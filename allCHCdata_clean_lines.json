    "INTRODUCTION Our Mission Calvert Hall College, a Lasallian Catholic college",
    "preparatory school, prepares a diverse community of young men to achieve their",
    "full potential utilizing their unique talents. Through excellent academic and",
    "extracurricular programs led by innovative and dedicated educators, our students",
    "become confident men with the ethical foundation for service, independent",
    "thinking, and responsible leadership. Inspired by the faith and zeal of St. John",
    "Baptist de La Salle, our students develop a respect for others as part of an",
    "inclusive, lifelong Calvert Hall brotherhood as Men of Intellect, Men of Faith, and",
    "Men of Integrity. The mission statement reflects the following common beliefs held",
    "by the Calvert Hall community: \u2666 We believe that a value-centered Catholic",
    "education based on the teachings of Saint John Baptist de La Salle is at the heart",
    "of Calvert Hall. \u2666 We believe that every student is entitled to an excellent academic",
    "education. \u2666 We believe that every student needs to be challenged to reach his full",
    "potential. \u2666 We believe that a college preparatory program provides every student",
    "with the skills to be a productive member of society. \u2666 We believe that every",
    "student needs the opportunity to cultivate his God-given gifts and talents. \u2666 We",
    "believe that a caring community develops the interpersonal relationships that are",
    "vital to the educational process. \u2666 We believe that the atmosphere of the Calvert",
    "Hall community promotes a brotherhood that endures beyond graduation. \u2666 We",
    "believe that Calvert Hall fosters an appreciation for the uniqueness of each person.",
    "The academic component of Calvert Hall\u2019s mission and beliefs is detailed in this",
    "Program of Studies. This document contains a complete listing and description of",
    "Calvert Hall\u2019s course offerings and academic requirements. This Program of",
    "Studies is an essential reference for the Calvert Hall School community of",
    "students, parents, guardians, teachers, and counselors regarding all aspects of",
    "academic affairs, including course selection 4 GRADUATE PROFILE A Man of",
    "Intellect \u2666 Demonstrates critical & logical thinking skills. \u2666 Exhibits proficiency in",
    "spoken and written communication. \u2666 Manifests the skills essential for success in",
    "higher education and life. \u2666 Values the arts, athletics, creativity, and fitness. \u2666",
    "Integrates technology for innovative problem solving. \u2666 Embraces the quest for",
    "knowledge. A Man of Faith \u2666 Understands Catholic moral and social teaching. \u2666 Is",
    "grounded in core Lasallian values. \u2666 Respects the dignity and uniqueness of",
    "others. \u2666 Recognizes and values his self-worth. \u2666 Values the sacredness of all life.",
    "\u2666 Performs meaningful service to the community. \u2666 Is conscious of the presence of",
    "God in his life. \u2666 Values the brotherhood of the Calvert Hall experience and",
    "tradition. A Man of Integrity \u2666 Makes sound ethical and moral decisions. \u2666 Acts",
    "with poise and civility. \u2666 Interacts with others honestly and maturely. \u2666 Accepts",
    "responsibility for his actions. \u2666 Thinks independently. \u2666 Provides leadership within",
    "the community. 5 ACADEMIC EXPECTATIONS The dignity and integrity of each",
    "individual student are essential components of genuine academic success. A",
    "Calvert Hall College High School diploma should recognize not only the successful",
    "completion of an academically rigorous course of study but also the formation of a",
    "young man with high ideals of morality, honesty, and respect for himself and his",
    "community. Furthermore, Calvert Hall College High School endeavors to create an",
    "atmosphere of personal and academic freedom and of mutual trust between",
    "students and faculty. Breaches of academic integrity by a student undermine an",
    "environment of freedom and trust. A student\u2019s acceptance of enrollment in Calvert",
    "Hall College High School and continuation of enrollment in Calvert Hall are",
    "contingent upon the student\u2019s acceptance of and adherence to the principles of",
    "student responsibility and academic honesty. STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES: \u2022 To",
    "complete all academic work honestly and independently, except in those instances",
    "in which an instructor clearly permits collaboration among students, for example,",
    "assigned group projects. (See \u201cAcademic Violations\u201d) \u2022 To acquaint themselves",
    "with the meaning of plagiarism, to learn how to properly cite sources used in",
    "submitted work, and to consult with instructors regarding the allowable resource",
    "materials or aids to be used during assessments (i.e.: tests) or in the completion of",
    "any graded work. \u2022 To refrain from revealing any information about an",
    "assessment's contents, directly or indirectly, to any other student who may later",
    "take the same assessment. ATTENDENCE: \u2022 Class attendance is essential to a",
    "student\u2019s academic success. Students should NOT be absent from school unless",
    "there is a serious reason. If a student needs to be absent, a parent is required to",
    "sign into the Calvert Hall website and complete the ABSENCE NOTIFICATION",
    "FORM via the Attendance Tile prior to 9:30am the day of the student\u2019s absence. \u2022",
    "The school does NOT approve of the non-academic/vacation absences during the",
    "academic calendar year. \u2022 Students missing three hours or more of a day will be",
    "marked \u201cABSENT\u201d. A student may not participate in cocurricular activities on the",
    "day of an absence. \u2022 Students missing 12 days or more may be required to attend",
    "academic study hall to compensate for missed instructional time. The Academic",
    "Study Hall (ASH) takes place both scheduled after-school sessions and on",
    "scheduled Saturdays. Additionally, a student may need to attend summer school,",
    "or may be required to withdraw from Calvert Hall resulting from excessive",
    "absences. \u2022 In instances of absences, the student is responsible for all academic",
    "work missed due to absences. 6 ACADEMIC VIOLATIONS An academic violation is",
    "a fraudulent act on the student\u2019s part as outlined in the Student Handbook (pg 15).",
    "An academic honesty violation will result in a failing grade of a zero (0) for the",
    "academic work. All academic honesty violations are reported to the Office of",
    "Academic Affairs (OAA). On any violation, parents or guardians will be notified by",
    "the reporting instructor and contacted by the OAA. Any ensuing violation requires",
    "the student, with his parents or guardians, to attend a conference with the Vice",
    "Principal (OAA). In addition to the policies enumerated above, academic honesty",
    "violations are subject to disciplinary action which may include suspension or",
    "expulsion. Additionally, academic honesty violations may affect eligibility or",
    "standing in the National Honor Society. Instances of Academic Violations can",
    "include, but are NOT limited to: \u2666 Plagiarizing or copying the academic work of",
    "another student and submitting it as one\u2019s own \u2666 Plagiarizing or copying or",
    "allowing another student to copy answers from an assignment, quiz, or test. \u2666",
    "Communicating/transmitting answers (verbally or non-verbally) during an",
    "assessment (i.e.: test or quiz). \u2666 Using notes or other unauthorized materials",
    "during an assignment, test, or quiz. \u2666 Gaining access to test questions or answers",
    "before a test without permission of the teacher. \u2666 Violating assignment, quiz, test,",
    "or assessment procedures established by the teacher. \u2666 Using unauthorized",
    "resources for take-home assignments without the expressed consent of the",
    "teacher. \u2666 Obtaining a paper from any source (a person, a text, on-line) and",
    "submitting as one\u2019s own work. \u2666 Violation of the school\u2019s Artificial Intelligence",
    "Policy (see below) PLAGIARISM Plagiarism is a situation in which one leads a",
    "reader to believe that written work submitted by the student is his own writing",
    "when it is not. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors: \u2666",
    "Directly copying part or all of another person\u2019s work and presenting it as your own.",
    "\u2666 Submission of papers or reports from commercial research companies, including",
    "on-line sources. \u2666 Copying portions of a text without crediting sources. \u2666",
    "Rephrasing another person\u2019s ideas and presenting them as your own without",
    "crediting sources. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE POLICY INTRODUCTION: Aligned",
    "with our Lasallian values of forming men of intellect, faith, and integrity, Calvert",
    "Hall recognizes AI's rapid transformative potential in education, professional life,",
    "and society. The Calvert Hall community prepares its students for success in a",
    "modern world, seeks to enhance all aspects of education, and maintains a",
    "competitive environment for both educators and students. It is recognized that AI",
    "also presents significant new risks and challenges that must be managed. This",
    "policy provides guidelines for responsible AI use while maintaining academic",
    "integrity and critical thinking skills. We affirm the importance of collaboration",
    "among administration, faculty, and students to ensure AI integration enhances",
    "learning while reflecting these core values. UNIVERSAL APPLICATION: This policy",
    "applies to all members of the Calvert Hall community, across all subjects and",
    "activities. It ensures that the principles of responsible AI use are embedded",
    "universally within the school's mission, operations and curriculum. Departmental,",
    "course specific guidelines will address the use of unique AI applications. These",
    "guidelines will be submitted to and reviewed by the Office of Academic Affairs and",
    "Technology Committee. 7 POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS: \u2022 Positive Uses: AI",
    "will be leveraged to personalize learning, provide additional support to students,",
    "and assist teachers in efficiency with administrative tasks. The benefits of AI in",
    "improving educational outcomes and efficiency will be emphasized. Examples",
    "would include AI-powered reading comprehension tools, language learning",
    "applications, and personalized practice problem generators. \u2022 Negative Uses: The",
    "policy will address potential risks, such as data privacy concerns, bias in AI",
    "algorithms, and over-reliance on technology. Clear guidelines will be established",
    "to mitigate these risks, including regular audits and monitoring of AI systems.",
    "Audits of AI tool usage patterns will be conducted, including regular privacy",
    "impact assessments, and student surveys on technology dependence.",
    "UPHOLDING SCHOOL BELIEFS AND INTEGRITY: \u2022 All AI usage at Calvert Hall will",
    "align with our core beliefs, including the school\u2019s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP),",
    "and the \"Expectations for Student Conduct\" section included in the Student",
    "Handbook. \u2022 AI use will be transparent. Students must disclose any AI assistance",
    "used in their work through proper citation and documentation. Any use of AI for",
    "academic dishonesty or unethical purposes will be prohibited. Disciplinary actions",
    "for violations will follow the guidelines provided under Student Handbook",
    "sections; Academics \u2013 Academic Honesty, and Student Conduct and Discipline. \u2022",
    "Course instructors have discretion and authority, using department-wide",
    "guidelines to determine the proper use of AI for any student produced academic",
    "work. \u2022 Misuse is to be reported promptly. Academic Expectations, including",
    "Student Responsibilities, Academic Violations and Plagiarism are detailed in the",
    "Calvert Hall Program of Studies. Violations can be reported to the Office of",
    "Academic Affairs, located in the Keelty Hall Front Office. CONCLUSION: By",
    "adhering to this policy, Calvert Hall aims to integrate AI in a manner that enriches",
    "our educational environment while maintaining Lasallian orthodoxy. We are",
    "committed to continuous learning and adaptation to ensure that AI is used",
    "responsibly and effectively for the benefit of all members of our community.",
    "Questions and concerns can be submitted to the Director of Technology, a",
    "permanent member of the CHC AI Task Force. 8 OVERVIEW OF GRADING",
    "ACADEMIC YEAR: The academic year at Calvert Hall is divided into two semesters.",
    "GRADE PUBLISHING & MONITORING: Regular online grade postings and",
    "scheduled Progress Reports offer a snapshot of a student\u2019s academic",
    "performance at a particular moment during the semester. The Office of Academic",
    "Affairs issues one Progress Report each semester. A parent or guardian is",
    "required to electronically verify Progress Reports. SEMESTER REPORT CARD: At",
    "the end of each semester, the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) issues a Semester",
    "Report Card. The Semester Report Card in each subject represents the cumulative",
    "average of all work done throughout the semester including the student\u2019s",
    "achievement on the semester exam. The first Semester Report Card is issued in",
    "January and the second Semester Report Card is issued in June. Parents are",
    "expected to verify electronically their receipt of the Progress Reports and",
    "Semester 1 Report Card. FINAL GRADE FOR THE YEAR: A student\u2019s final grade for",
    "a course is determined by taking the average of the grades on the two Semester",
    "Report Cards except for single semester courses which must be passed",
    "independently. Faculty members, with approval of the OAA, may override the",
    "numerical average of the semester grade in determining a final grade. SEMESTER",
    "EXAMINATIONS: Semester exams are usually given in December and June (in May",
    "for seniors). Semester exams count for 15% of the overall semester grade. Exams",
    "are administered in all full credit courses unless otherwise noted. Students must",
    "take their semester exams on the scheduled day unless illness prevents them from",
    "attending school. In such cases, the school should be notified via an online",
    "attendance form, and a doctor\u2019s note is required upon returning to school.",
    "Students who miss an exam and do not present a doctor\u2019s note for their absence",
    "may have their exam grade penalized a minimum of 15%. Students taking",
    "Advanced Placement courses do not take spring semester exams in those",
    "courses. Senior teachers may exempt individual seniors who have a 90% or higher",
    "average for their final grade from the final semester exam of a course.",
    "PROMOTION REQUIREMENTS: To be promoted to the next grade, students are",
    "required to enroll in six full credit courses and earn a passing grade in each",
    "course. A passing grade is a final grade of at least 70. All courses at Calvert Hall",
    "are worth either 1 credit or \u00bd credit. A unit of credit (1) is awarded for the",
    "completion of a class in which the student has completed all course requirements.",
    "A half unit of credit (\u00bd) is awarded for the completion of a class (generally with",
    "less required instructional time) in which the student has completed all course",
    "requirements. At the end of an academic year, students with fewer than three",
    "credit failures must remove these failures in an approved summer program to",
    "return to Calvert Hall in the following academic year. Students with three or more",
    "credit failures at the end of an academic year must withdraw from Calvert Hall.",
    "Early or accelerated graduation is not available in the Calvert Hall Program of",

    "due to special circumstances, may receive a course grade of \"I\" for \u201cIncomplete.\u201d",
    "A student will be given a set time frame (up to one week) to resolve the",
    "\u201cIncomplete\u201d by completing all course requirements as established by the teacher.",
    "With the approval of the Office of Academic Affairs, the deadline for resolving an",
    "\u201cIncomplete\u201d may be modified. UNWEIGHTED GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA): A",
    "numerical Unweighted Grade Point Average is determined according to the",
    "following formula: (Sum of 1 Credit Course Grades) + .5(Sum of \u00bd Credit Course",
    "Grades) Number of Credits Taken Note: Physical Education I/Health and Physical",
    "Education II do not count toward GPA. SAMPLE COURSE LOAD COURSE: GRADE",

    "CUMULATIVE NUMERIC AVERAGES: Calvert Hall does not rank students",
    "according to academic performance. In addition to an Unweighted GPA (described",
    "above), Calvert Hall determines an Unweighted Cumulative Numeric Average and a",
    "Weighted Cumulative Numeric Average for each student. These are the GPAs that",
    "consider every semester of a student\u2019s Calvert Hall career. In their calculation,",
    "Weighted Cumulative Numeric Averages include bonus points that effectively",
    "reward students for completing Honors and AP classes. HONOR ROLL: The Honor",
    "Roll status of each student is determined at the end of each semester. Honor Roll",
    "status is awarded to each student who has achieved a semester GPA of 88 or",
    "higher with no single course grade below an 81. (Please note that the threshold for",
    "a semester GPA of 88 is strict. A semester GPA of even 87.999 is NOT rounded up.)",
    "Each student who makes the Honor Roll is awarded an optional Honor Roll",
    "Holiday. The Honor Roll Holiday must be taken during the semester immediately",
    "after the earned Honor Roll status. An Honor Roll Holiday Form is available in the",
    "Attendance Office and on the Academic Affairs Tile. The form must be signed by",
    "teachers and parents and then submitted to the Attendance Office TWO days prior",
    "to the holiday. Parents/guardians will need to call the Attendance Office to verify",
    "the holiday. Students who fail to follow these procedures may have their Honor",
    "Roll holiday denied. Students who earn Honor Roll status for both semesters of an",
    "academic year will receive an Academic Letter the first year and an Academic Star",
    "for any subsequent year. Academic Letters / Stars are awarded in the Fall of the",
    "following academic year. HONOR CUP: The Calvert Hall Honor Cup is awarded to",
    "the graduating senior who has earned the highest weighted GPA for ALL four",
    "years at Calvert Hall. The cup is awarded at the Commencement Ceremony and will",
    "have the student\u2019s name and class year inscribed on the Cup. VALEDICTORIAN: At",
    "the Commencement Ceremony, a graduating senior, the valedictorian, delivers the",
    "traditional farewell address in the name of the senior class. Any senior in good",

    "PROGRAMS THE MCMULLEN SCHOLARS PROGRAM: Qualifying top students are",
    "considered for the McMullen Scholars Program, a distinguished honors program",
    "designed for students ready to dedicate themselves to a highly demanding",
    "workload with challenging and stimulating advanced courses, unique cultural and",
    "academic field experiences, and original research opportunities. The highly",
    "competitive McMullen Scholars Program involves an integrated program of study.",
    "Students engage in accelerated content of Honors and Advanced Placement",
    "courses, and they are required to take additional courses in Honors Rhetoric and",
    "Logic, Humanities, and the Honors McMullen Capstone Research Seminar. THE",
    "BROTHER TOM MILLER HONORS PROGRAM: The Brother Tom Miller Honors",
    "Program stimulates a student\u2019s love for learning by challenging him with rigorous",
    "course offerings and developing his whole person with cultural experiences and",
    "leadership opportunities outside the traditional classroom setting. LA SALLE",
    "PROGRAM: The La Salle Program serves a group of college-bound students with",
    "identified language learning difficulties. The program focuses on skills and",
    "strategies rather than content with the goal of remediating weak reading and",
    "writing skills while increasing the student\u2019s understanding of his learning",
    "strengths and needs as he becomes his own advocate. The students are fully",
    "integrated into the academic program of the school. In addition to their regularly",
    "scheduled classes, La Salle students have an additional class added to their",
    "schedule in which they meet individually with their Learning Specialists. The class",
    "meets one period each day for six times per academic cycle. Consequently, La",
    "Salle students will have adjustments in their individual schedules to properly",
    "schedule a full course schedule. ACADEMIC SKILLS PROGRAM (ASP): The",
    "purpose of the Academic Support Program is to build skills and strategies in",
    "organization, time management, and study strategies to increase students\u2019",
    "independence and success in high school, college, and beyond. Students",
    "accepted into this program meet with a learning specialist for one period every",
    "other day for three times per cycle in groups of three to five students. A student in",
    "this program may have a diagnosed learning difference such as ADHD or",
    "Executive Function Disorder or may want more instruction to improve in these",
    "areas. ASP is generally reserved for students in their freshmen and/or sophomore",
    "year. If a student is in ASP as a junior or senior, the flexibility in his schedule does",
    "not necessitate any special scheduling rules. LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE: Any",
    "Calvert Hall student can earn a certificate in leadership at graduation by",
    "completing three years (sophomore through senior levels) of a program that",
    "includes leadership seminars, attendance at the Leadership Dinner Speaker",
    "Series, participation in field trips, two overnight retreat experiences, and courses",
    "on both the junior and senior levels. A critical piece of this program will include",
    "participation in clubs and activities as well as the completion of a Leadership",
    "Practicum experience that will put leadership skills into practice. STEM",
    "PROGRAM: As an integrated educational and experiential program of academics",
    "and activities, the STEM Program is designed to encourage students as they",
    "develop the skills of problem-solving, discovery, and investigative learning.",
    "Students transfer formal classroom experiences into dynamic and meaningful",
    "activities outside of the classroom in the practical application of STEM in the 21st",
    "century. 13 NATIONAL HONOR SOCIETY - SELECTION CRITERIA Membership in",
    "Calvert Hall\u2019s chapter of the National Honor Society is a privilege bestowed on",
    "those students who demonstrate outstanding performance in scholarship, service,",
    "character, and leadership. Students who are interested in applying to the NHS will",
    "be required to go to a membership meeting in the second semester to prepare",
    "their applications for membership. Students will be conditionally accepted in the",
    "spring pending grade verification after exams. SCHOLARSHIP: Candidates eligible",
    "for selection to this chapter must be members of the sophomore or junior class,",
    "have been enrolled for at least one semester at Calvert Hall, and have a minimum",
    "Unweighted Cumulative Numeric Average of 90.0% or a minimum Weighted",
    "Cumulative Numeric Average of 93.0%. SERVICE: A candidate must demonstrate at",
    "least two years of active participation in one or more Calvert Hall activities for",
    "which a Calvert Hall letter is awarded. These include the following: Athletic teams",
    "(Fresh/Soph; JV; or Varsity), Band, CHC TV, Communications, Cyber Security,",
    "Hallmen, It\u2019s Academic, Model UN, Mock Trial, Newspaper, Robotics, Speech,",
    "Student Council, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Executive Board, Theatre, and",
    "Yearbook. One or more years of the service requirement may also be met by",
    "performing a total of 150 hours (per year) of service in several different activities.",
    "These hours must be documented by the staff member for whom they were",
    "performed. Leisure time activities, such as intramurals or some clubs, or service",
    "outside of Calvert Hall (such as Boy Scouts or altar server) do not count toward",
    "the Calvert Hall service requirement. In addition, a student must have at least eight",
    "hours of approved community service completed during their sophomore or junior",
    "year. CHARACTER AND LEADERSHIP: A student must demonstrate positive",
    "leadership qualities in the classroom and in school activities. Candidates will be",
    "required to complete an essay on leadership. Also, candidates are required to",
    "demonstrate exemplary character by not having any record of discipline for a",
    "serious offense, such as those listed in the Discipline Policies section of the",
    "Student Handbook and Regulations, having no more than one violation of a school",
    "rule per year, and by receiving positive teacher evaluations. 14 DUAL",
    "ENROLLMENT Calvert Hall offers a Dual Enrollment Program through Notre Dame",
    "University of Maryland (NDMU) for students who are seeking more rigorous course",
    "work to strengthen their academic profile. Students who successfully complete",
    "Dual Enrollment courses will earn credit from NDMU, which can be submitted to",
    "the college of their choice. The college retains the discretion to accept or not",
    "accept transferred credit. NDMU DUAL ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS \u2022 Dual",
    "Enrollment participation must be approved by the Office of Academic Affairs and",
    "is for current students only and cannot be applied retroactively. \u2022 Students must be",
    "in good academic standing (3.00 unweighted GPA or higher) at registration. \u2022",
    "Students must be at least 16 years or older at the start of the Dual Enrollment",
    "course. \u2022 Students must have a recommendation from a school counselor. \u2022 CHC",
    "pre-approved courses are released each Fall once approved by the Academic Dean",
    "of NDMU. These courses will be included on the CHC transcript and calculated into",
    "a student\u2019s GPA. ENRICHMENT COURSES Calvert Hall encourages students to",
    "enroll in enrichment courses at their own discretion. Students should enroll in",
    "courses to reflect their interests. The approved courses for credit will NOT be",
    "calculated toward a student\u2019s overall GPA nor included on their CHC transcript.",
    "CHC recommends enrichment course offered by Catholic Virtual. The current",
    "catalogue of academic offerings can be found HERE Additionally, Calvert Hall does",
    "offer courses for summer enrichment that can earn original credit courses. Each",
    "course has received prior approval from OAA as original credit. Enrollment in",
    "approved summer enrichment courses DOES NOT permit a student to accelerate",
    "graduation and students are still expected to enroll in six full credit courses in the",
    "following academic year. In cases of low student enrollment, a summer course",
    "may close. Each summer\u2019s original credit course will include a course fee. The",
    "Course selection Tile displays information about approved summer courses for",
    "original credit for the upcoming Academic Year: FIELD TRIP INFORMATION The",
    "Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) believes that a student\u2019s education can extend",
    "beyond the traditional classroom setting. Field trips are a valuable experience that",
    "can enrich a student\u2019s academic experience. All field trips will need the approval of",
    "the OAA and should be scheduled to present the smallest interruption to the",
    "academic calendar and the student\u2019s instructional time. The general timeline for",
    "field trips are between Oct and the end of April. Fields trips will not be allowed",
    "during December, May, or June because of the consideration of Semester Exams.",
    "All field trips are considered optional endeavors and therefore students do have",
    "the choice of \u201copting out\u201d of any field trip experience without course penalty. In",
    "such cases, students must be present for the school day and attend all classes as",
    "scheduled. The teacher of the course may issue alternative work for students who",
    "choose to \u201copt out\u201d of the field trip in lieu of attending. 15 COURSE",
    "SELECTION/PLACEMENT PROCESS AND TIMELINE The course placement",
    "process is an integral part of the student\u2019s schedule creation. It requires care,",
    "discussion, and commitment from the student, his parents, and the school.",
    "Utilizing input from the student, his current teachers, his school counselors and",
    "when needed, the Office of Academic Affairs, the objective is to create a student",
    "schedule that provides the highest level of academic rigor and offers the student",
    "an opportunity for success. After final approval, a student\u2019s schedule will not be",
    "adjusted unless there is a serious educational reason. As a rule, \u201cwhat a student",
    "chooses in the course placement process in spring Semester, is what the student",
    "will take in the following semester.\u201d A student\u2019s course level placement need not",
    "be permanent for his entire Calvert Hall career. Students who wish to move up a",
    "level in a subject will need high performing academic achievement and their",
    "current course teacher\u2019s recommendation. Typically, students will not be allowed",
    "to have level changes in more than THREE courses in a single academic year. The",
    "Office of Academic Affairs will have the final say in any course movement for a",
    "student. The following timeline is a guide to the course placement process. All",
    "course placements are subject to final review and approval by the Office of",
    "Academic Affairs. Course placements may be adjusted to accommodate the proper",
    "scheduling of a student\u2019s courseload. \u2022 MID-FEBRUARY: o Course",
    "recommendations by a student\u2019s current teachers \u2022 MID-FEBRUARY TO MARCH: o",
    "Review of teacher recommendations by student, parents, guardians in conjunction",

    "therefore unavailable*** ***A more detailed step-by-step outline of the course",
    "placement process can be found on the Course Placement Tile on the Resource",
    "Portal*** 16 ACADEMIC CLASSIFICATION OF COURSES At Calvert Hall, every",
    "course is college preparatory in nature. Every course is either \u00bd Credit or 1 Credit.",
    "Over an academic year, a \u00bd Credit course typically meets less often than a 1 Credit",
    "course. Two \u00bd Credit courses cannot be combined to replace a 1 credit course",
    "requirement. Each academic course is classified according to one of four",
    "academic classifications. In order of increasing academic rigor, they are the",
    "following: COLLEGE PREP B LEVEL: These courses are designed with",
    "skill-building in mind. Increased attention is given to writing skills, reading skills,",
    "and study skills. The speed of each course varies, but the workload tends to be",
    "stable. Instructors will cover all essential topics in alignment with College Prep A",
    "courses. The prerequisite for enrollment in College Prep B courses is a current",
    "teacher recommendation. COLLEGE PREP A LEVEL: These courses are designed",
    "to challenge students who have adequately mastered skills. Sustained academic",
    "performance and satisfactory standardized testing results are used to support",
    "placement. The prerequisite for enrollment in College Prep A courses is a current",
    "teacher recommendation. HONORS LEVEL: These courses are designed to",
    "challenge students who have demonstrated excellence in academic performance",
    "and standardized testing results. These courses were designed for students who",
    "can navigate an increased workload. Tests, assignments, class discussions, and",
    "other assessments are crafted to help Honors Level students prepare for eventual",
    "AP Level consideration. The prerequisites for enrollment in Honors Level courses",
    "include current teacher recommendation and department approval. AP LEVEL:",
    "Students enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP) Level courses have demonstrated",
    "the highest level of academic performance and standardized test results. Students",
    "enrolled in AP Level courses must register for and complete the official AP Exam",
    "associated with the course. There is a fee for the AP Exam. The prerequisites for",
    "enrollment in AP Level courses include current teacher recommendation and",
    "department approval. ACADEMIC ACCOMODATIONS Calvert Hall students are",
    "legally eligible to receive a variety of academic accommodations. Calvert Hall will",
    "extend classroom accommodation within the reasonable capacity of our",
    "resources. To receive academic accommodation, a request for accommodation will",
    "be registered with School Counseling. The student will then need to be",
    "professionally evaluated and diagnosed with a learning disability. The current list",
    "of accommodation afforded to qualified students includes Preferential Seating,",
    "Extended Testing Time, Test administration in a designated testing center, no",
    "penalty for in-class spelling errors, note-taking/lecture support, use of assistive",
    "electronic device as needed. Additional unspecified accommodation can be issued",
    "on a limited basis in consultation with the School Counseling department and the",
    "Office of Academic Affairs. For the steps to be considered regarding",
    "accommodations, please contact the student\u2019s school counselor. 17 COURSE",
    "DESCRIPTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR FRESHMEN, SOPHOMORE, JUNIOR,",
    "AND SENIOR YEARS The pages that follow contain a detailed description of the",
    "courses available and required for each academic grade level. Included will be",
    "Program exceptions and credits needed for grade promotion. When reviewing the",
    "course descriptions, students should take note of any prerequisites necessary for",
    "each course. Students should read each course description carefully and consider",
    "meeting with a course teacher or Department Chair to have a better understanding",
    "of the course requirements. In general, all courses need a recommendation by the",
    "student\u2019s current teacher. All AP courses need a current teacher\u2019s",
    "recommendation and Department approval. Department approval is by the",
    "Department Chair or the teacher of the AP course. Some courses will require a",
    "minimum grade as part of the requirement for enrollment. Students taking an AP",
    "course are required to take the AP exam. Failure to do so can prevent enrollment",
    "in future AP courses. 18 FRESHMEN YEAR - COURSES AND REQUIREMENTS",
    "(Page 1 of 2) Course Placement for Freshmen year is completed by the Office of",
    "Academic Affairs (OAA). OAA examines a student\u2019s admission index, his middle",

    "performance of students from previous years to determine the appropriate course",
    "placements. Freshmen students are placed in the most challenging curriculum that",
    "the OAA believes will yield a favorable grade point average (GPA) via a reasonable",

    "INTRODUCTION Our Mission Calvert Hall College, a Lasallian Catholic college",
    "preparatory school, prepares a diverse community of young men to achieve their full",
    "potential utilizing their unique talents. Through excellent academic and extracurricular",
    "programs led by innovative and dedicated educators, our students become confident",
    "men with the ethical foundation for service, independent thinking, and responsible",
    "leadership. Inspired by the faith and zeal of St. John Baptist de La Salle, our students",
    "develop a respect for others as part of an inclusive, lifelong Calvert Hall brotherhood",
    "as Men of Intellect, Men of Faith, and Men of Integrity. The mission statement reflects",
    "the following common beliefs held by the Calvert Hall community: \u2666 We believe that a",
    "value-centered Catholic education based on the teachings of Saint John Baptist de",
    "La Salle is at the heart of Calvert Hall. \u2666 We believe that every student is entitled to",
    "an excellent academic education. \u2666 We believe that every student needs to be",
    "challenged to reach his full potential. \u2666 We believe that a college preparatory",
    "program provides every student with the skills to be a productive member of society.",
    "\u2666 We believe that every student needs the opportunity to cultivate his God-given gifts",
    "and talents. \u2666 We believe that a caring community develops the interpersonal",
    "relationships that are vital to the educational process. \u2666 We believe that the",
    "atmosphere of the Calvert Hall community promotes a brotherhood that endures",
    "beyond graduation. \u2666 We believe that Calvert Hall fosters an appreciation for the",
    "uniqueness of each person. The academic component of Calvert Hall\u2019s mission and",
    "beliefs is detailed in this Program of Studies. This document contains a complete",
    "listing and description of Calvert Hall\u2019s course offerings and academic requirements.",
    "This Program of Studies is an essential reference for the Calvert Hall School",
    "community of students, parents, guardians, teachers, and counselors regarding all",
    "aspects of academic affairs, including course selection. 4 GRADUATE PROFILE A",
    "Man of Intellect \u2666 Demonstrates critical & logical thinking skills. \u2666 Exhibits proficiency",
    "in spoken and written communication. \u2666 Manifests the skills essential for success in",
    "higher education and life. \u2666 Values the arts, athletics, creativity, and fitness. \u2666",
    "Integrates technology for innovative problem solving. \u2666 Embraces the quest for",
    "knowledge. A Man of Faith \u2666 Understands Catholic moral and social teaching. \u2666 Is",
    "grounded in core Lasallian values. \u2666 Respects the dignity and uniqueness of others.",
    "\u2666 Recognizes and values his self-worth. \u2666 Values the sacredness of all life. \u2666",
    "Performs meaningful service to the community. \u2666 Is conscious of the presence of",
    "God in his life. \u2666 Values the brotherhood of the Calvert Hall experience and tradition.",
    "A Man of Integrity \u2666 Makes sound ethical and moral decisions. \u2666 Acts with poise and",
    "civility. \u2666 Interacts with others honestly and maturely. \u2666 Accepts responsibility for his",
    "actions. \u2666 Thinks independently. \u2666 Provides leadership within the community. 5",
    "ACADEMIC EXPECTATIONS The dignity and integrity of each individual student are",
    "essential components of genuine academic success. A Calvert Hall College High",
    "School diploma should recognize not only the successful completion of an",
    "academically rigorous course of study but also the formation of a young man with",
    "high ideals of morality, honesty, and respect for himself and his community.",
    "Furthermore, Calvert Hall College High School endeavors to create an atmosphere of",
    "personal and academic freedom and of mutual trust between students and faculty.",
    "Breaches of academic integrity by a student undermine an environment of freedom",
    "and trust. A student\u2019s acceptance of enrollment in Calvert Hall College High School",
    "and continuation of enrollment in Calvert Hall are contingent upon the student\u2019s",
    "acceptance of and adherence to the principles of student responsibility and academic",
    "honesty. STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES To complete all academic work honestly",
    "and independently, except in those instances in which an instructor clearly permits",
    "collaboration among students, for example, assigned group projects. (See \u201cAcademic",
    "Cheating\u201d) To acquaint themselves with the meaning of plagiarism, to learn how to",
    "properly cite sources used in submitted work, and to consult with instructors",
    "regarding the allowable resource materials or aids to be used during assessments",
    "(i.e.: tests) or in the completion of any graded work. To refrain from revealing any",
    "information about an assessment's contents, directly or indirectly, to any other",
    "student who may later take the same assessment. ATTENDENCE: Class attendance",
    "is essential to a student\u2019s academic success. Students should NOT be absent from",
    "school unless there is a serious reason. If a student needs to be absent, a parent is",
    "required to sign into the Calvert Hall website and complete the ABSENCE",
    "NOTIFICATION FORM via the Attendance Tile prior to 9:30am the day of the",
    "student\u2019s absence. The school does NOT approve of the non-academic/vacation",
    "absences. Students missing three hours or more of a day will be marked absent. A",
    "student may not participate in cocurricular activities on the day of an absence.",
    "Students missing 12 days or more will be required to attend after-school/Saturday",
    "academic sessions, attend summer school, or be required to withdraw from Calvert",
    "Hall. In instances of absences, the student is responsible for all academic work",
    "missed due to absences. ACADEMIC VIOLATIONS An academic violation is a",
    "fraudulent act on the student\u2019s part. It includes, but is NOT limited to: \u2666 Copying",
    "answers from another student\u2019s assignment, quiz, or test. \u2666 Allowing another student",
    "to copy answers from an assignment, quiz, or test. \u2666 Communicating/transmitting",
    "answers (verbally or non-verbally) during an assessment (i.e.: test or quiz). \u2666 Using",
    "notes or other unauthorized materials during an assignment, test, or quiz. \u2666 Gaining",
    "access to test questions or answers before a test without permission of the teacher. \u2666",
    "Violating assignment, quiz, test, or assessment procedures established by the",
    "teacher. \u2666 Copying the work of another student and submitting it as one\u2019s own. 6 \u2666",
    "Collaborating with others or with written materials in take-home assignments unless",
    "expressly allowed to do so by the teacher. \u2666 Obtaining a paper from any source (a",
    "person, a text, on-line) and submitting it to a teacher as one\u2019s own work.",
    "PLAGIARISM Plagiarism is a situation in which one leads a reader to believe that",
    "written work submitted by the student is his own writing when it is not. Plagiarism",
    "includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors: \u2666 Directly copying part or all of",
    "another person\u2019s work and presenting it as your own. \u2666 Submission of papers or",
    "reports from commercial research companies, including on-line sources. \u2666 Copying",
    "portions of a text without crediting sources. \u2666 Rephrasing another person\u2019s ideas and",
    "presenting them as your own without crediting sources. An academic honesty",
    "violation will result in a failing grade of a zero (0) for the academic work. All academic",
    "honesty violations are reported to the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA). On any",
    "violation, parents or guardians will be notified by the reporting instructor and",
    "contacted by the OAA. Any ensuing violation requires the student, with his parents or",
    "guardians, to attend a conference with the Assistant Principal for Academic Affairs. In",
    "addition to the policies enumerated above, academic honesty violations are subject",
    "to disciplinary action which may include suspension or expulsion. Additionally,",
    "academic honesty violations may affect eligibility or standing in the National Honor",
    "Society. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE USAGE POLICY As a school, Calvert Hall",
    "recognizes the growing importance of technology in education and the increasing",
    "role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in student learning and within our educational",
    "environment. Use of these tools must align and be consistent with our principles of",
    "academic honesty and the Acceptable Use policy for Technology. This policy outlines",
    "the expectations of responsible student usage of AI in all academic work. Any",
    "student's use of AI without prior course teacher approval will be considered a",
    "violation of academic honesty. Consequently, any AI related violation will be subject",
    "to the school Academic Honesty policy as outlined in the Student Handbook (Page",
    "15) and reported to the Office of Academic Affairs. Student must ensure that any",
    "work produced using AI tools reflects the student\u2019s own understanding and learning",
    "of the material. Plagiarism in any form is strictly prohibited and includes the",
    "copying/usage of AI-generated content without prior teacher approval and therefore",
    "proper attribution/citation per course policy. 7 OVERVIEW OF GRADING ACADEMIC",
    "YEAR: The academic year at Calvert Hall is divided into two semesters. GRADE",
    "MONITORING: daily, students and parents may monitor grades online. Additionally,",
    "the Office of Academic Affairs issues one Progress Report each semester. A parent",
    "or guardian is required to electronically verify Progress Reports. Day-to-day grade",
    "postings and Progress Reports offer a snapshot of a student\u2019s academic",
    "performance at a particular moment during the semester. SEMESTER REPORT",
    "CARD: At the end of each semester, the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) issues a",
    "Semester Report Card. The Semester Report Card in each subject represents the",
    "cumulative average of all work done throughout the semester including the student\u2019s",
    "achievement on the semester exam. The first Semester Report Card is issued in",
    "January and the second Semester Report Card is issued in June. Parents are",
    "expected to verify electronically their receipt of the Progress Reports and Semester 1",
    "Report Card. FINAL GRADE FOR THE YEAR: A student\u2019s final grade for a course is",
    "determined by taking the average of the grades on the two Semester Report Cards",
    "except for single semester courses which must be passed independently. Faculty",
    "members, with approval of the OAA, may override the numerical average of the",
    "semester grade in determining a final grade. SEMESTER EXAMINATIONS:",
    "Semester exams are usually given in December and June (in May for seniors).",
    "Semester exams count for 15% of the overall semester grade. Exams are",
    "administered in all full credit courses unless otherwise noted. Students must take",
    "their semester exams on the scheduled day unless illness prevents them from",
    "attending school. In such cases, the school should be notified via an online",
    "attendance form, and a doctor\u2019s note is required upon returning to school. Students",
    "who miss an exam and do not present a doctor\u2019s note for their absence will have",
    "their exam grade penalized a minimum of 15%. Students taking Advanced",
    "Placement courses do not take spring semester exams in those courses. Senior",
    "teachers may exempt individual seniors who have a 90% or higher average for their",
    "final grade from the final semester exam of a course. PROMOTION",
    "REQUIREMENTS: To be promoted to the next grade, students are required to enroll",
    "in six full credit courses and earn a passing grade in each course. A passing grade is",
    "a final grade of at least 70. All courses at Calvert Hall are worth either 1 credit or \u00bd",
    "credit. A unit of credit (1) is awarded for the completion of a class in which the",
    "student has completed all course requirements. A half unit of credit (\u00bd) is awarded",
    "for the completion of a class (generally with less required instructional time) in which",
    "the student has completed all course requirements. At the end of an academic year,",
    "students with fewer than three credit failures must remove these failures in an",
    "approved summer program to return to Calvert Hall in the following academic year.",
    "Students with three or more credit failures at the end of an academic year must",
    "withdraw from Calvert Hall. Early or accelerated graduation is not available in the",

    "9 CUMULATIVE NUMERIC AVERAGES: Calvert Hall does not rank students",
    "according to academic performance. In addition to an Unweighted GPA (described",
    "above), Calvert Hall determines an Unweighted Cumulative Numeric Average and a",
    "Weighted Cumulative Numeric Average for each student. These are the GPAs that",
    "consider every semester of a student\u2019s Calvert Hall career. In their calculation,",
    "Weighted Cumulative Numeric Averages include bonus points that effectively reward",
    "students for completing Honors and AP classes. HONOR ROLL: The Honor Roll",
    "status of each student is determined at the end of each semester. Honor Roll status",
    "is awarded to each student who has achieved a semester GPA of 88 or higher with",
    "no single course grade below an 81. (Please note that the threshold for a semester",
    "GPA of 88 is strict. A semester GPA of even 87.999 is NOT rounded up.) Each",
    "student who makes the Honor Roll is awarded an optional Honor Roll Holiday. The",
    "Honor Roll Holiday must be taken during the semester immediately after the earned",
    "Honor Roll status. An Honor Roll Holiday Form is available in the Attendance Office",
    "and on the Academic Affairs Tile. The form must be signed by teachers and parents",
    "and then submitted to the Attendance Office TWO days prior to the holiday.",
    "Parents/guardians will need to call the Attendance Office to verify the holiday.",
    "Students who fail to follow these procedures may have their Honor Roll holiday",
    "denied. Students who earn Honor Roll status for both semesters of an academic year",
    "will receive an Academic Letter the first year and an Academic Star for any",
    "subsequent year. Academic Letters / Stars are awarded in the Fall of the following",
    "academic year. HONOR CUP \u2013 The Calvert Hall Honor Cup is awarded to the",
    "graduating senior who has earned the highest weighted GPA for ALL four years at",
    "Calvert Hall. The cup is awarded at the Commencement Ceremony and will have the",
    "student\u2019s name and class year inscribed on the Cup. VALEDICTORIAN \u2013 At the",
    "Commencement Ceremony, a graduating senior, the valedictorian, delivers the",
    "traditional farewell address in the name of the senior class. Any senior in good",
    "standing is eligible to compete, and one senior will be selected from a field of",
    "self-nominating students by the selection committee. For more information,",
    "graduating seniors should see Mr. Parisi in Student Affairs. 10 GRADUATION",
    "REQUIREMENTS: All students at Calvert Hall are required to complete a",
    "comprehensive college preparatory program to graduate as indicated below:",

    "DISTINGUISHED ACADEMIC PROGRAMS THE MCMULLEN SCHOLARS",
    "PROGRAM: Qualifying top students are considered for the McMullen Scholars",
    "Program, a distinguished honors program designed for students ready to dedicate",
    "themselves to a highly demanding workload with challenging and stimulating",
    "advanced courses, unique cultural and academic field experiences, and original",
    "research opportunities. The highly competitive McMullen Scholars Program involves",
    "an integrated program of study. Students engage in accelerated content of Honors",
    "and Advanced Placement courses, and they are required to take additional courses",
    "in Honors Rhetoric and Logic, Humanities, and the Honors McMullen Capstone",
    "Research Seminar. THE BROTHER TOM MILLER HONORS PROGRAM: The",
    "Brother Tom Miller Honors Program stimulates a student\u2019s love for learning by",
    "challenging him with rigorous course offerings and developing his whole person with",
    "cultural experiences and leadership opportunities outside the traditional classroom",
    "setting. LA SALLE PROGRAM: The La Salle Program serves a group of",
    "college-bound students with identified language learning difficulties. The program",
    "focuses on skills and strategies rather than content with the goal of remediating weak",
    "reading and writing skills while increasing the student\u2019s understanding of his learning",
    "strengths and needs as he becomes his own advocate. The students are fully",
    "integrated into the academic program of the school. In addition to their regularly",
    "scheduled classes, La Salle students have an additional class added to their",
    "schedule in which they meet individually with their Learning Specialists. The class",
    "meets one period each day for six times per academic cycle. Consequently, La Salle",
    "students will have adjustments in their individual schedules to properly schedule a full",
    "course schedule (See the course requirements for each class year to review potential",
    "adjustments) ACADEMIC SKILLS PROGRAM (ASP): The purpose of the Academic",
    "Support Program is to build skills and strategies in organization, time management,",
    "and study strategies to increase students\u2019 independence and success in high school,",
    "college, and beyond. Students accepted into this program meet with a learning",
    "specialist for one period every other day for three times per cycle in groups of three",
    "to five students. A student in this program may have a diagnosed learning difference",
    "such as ADHD or Executive Function Disorder or may want more instruction to",
    "improve in these areas. ASP is generally reserved for students in their freshmen",
    "and/or sophomore year. If a student is in ASP as a junior or senior, the flexibility in his",
    "schedule does not necessitate any special scheduling rules. LEADERSHIP",
    "INSTITUTE: Any Calvert Hall student can earn a certificate in leadership at",
    "graduation by completing three years (sophomore through senior levels) of a",
    "program that includes leadership seminars, attendance at the Leadership Dinner",
    "Speaker Series, participation in field trips, two overnight retreat experiences, and",
    "courses on both the junior and senior levels. A critical piece of this program will",
    "include participation in clubs and activities as well as the completion of a Leadership",
    "Practicum experience that will put leadership skills into practice. STEM PROGRAM:",
    "As an integrated educational and experiential program of academics and activities,",
    "the STEM Program is designed to encourage students as they develop the skills of",
    "problem-solving, discovery, and investigative learning. Students transfer formal",
    "classroom experiences into dynamic and meaningful activities outside of the",
    "classroom in the practical application of STEM in the 21st century. 12 NATIONAL",
    "HONOR SOCIETY - SELECTION CRITERIA Membership in Calvert Hall\u2019s chapter of",
    "the National Honor Society is a privilege bestowed on those students who",
    "demonstrate outstanding performance in scholarship, service, character, and",
    "leadership. Students who are interested in applying to the NHS will be required to go",
    "to a membership meeting in the second semester to prepare their applications for",

    "Mock Trial, Newspaper, Robotics, Speech, Student Council, Unmanned Aerial",
    "Vehicle, Executive Board, Theatre, and Yearbook. One or more years of the service",
    "requirement may also be met by performing a total of 150 hours (per year) of service",
    "in several different activities. These hours must be documented by the staff member",
    "for whom they were performed. Leisure time activities, such as intramurals or some",
    "clubs, or service outside of Calvert Hall (such as Boy Scouts or altar server) does not",

    "Hall offers a Dual Enrollment Program through Notre Dame University of Maryland",
    "(NDMU) for students who are seeking more rigorous course work to strengthen their",
    "academic profile. Students who successfully complete Dual Enrollment courses will",
    "earn credit from NDMU, which can be submitted to the college of their choice. The",
    "college retains the discretion to accept or not accept transferred credit. NDMU Dual",
    "Enrollment Requirements Dual Enrollment participation must be approved by the",
    "Office of Academic Affairs and is for current students only and cannot be applied",
    "retroactively. Students must be in good academic standing (3.00 unweighted GPA or",
    "higher) at registration. Students must be at least 16 years or older at the start of the",
    "Dual Enrollment course. Students must have a recommendation from a school",
    "counselor. CHC pre-approved courses are released each Fall once approved by the",
    "Academic Dean of NDMU. These courses will be included on the CHC transcript and",
    "calculated into a student\u2019s GPA. ENRICHMENT COURSES Calvert Hall encourages",
    "students to enroll in enrichment courses at their own discretion. Students should",
    "enroll in courses to reflect their interests. The approved courses for credit will NOT",
    "be calculated toward a student\u2019s overall GPA nor included on their CHC transcript.",
    "CHC recommends enrichment course offered by Catholic Virtual. The current",
    "catalogue of academic offerings can be found HERE Additionally, Calvert Hall does",
    "offer courses for summer enrichment that can earn original credit courses. Each",
    "course has received prior approval from OAA as original credit. Enrollment in",
    "approved summer enrichment courses DOES NOT permit a student to accelerate",
    "graduation and students are still expected to enroll in six full credit courses in the",
    "following academic year. In cases of low student enrollment, a summer course may",
    "close. Each summer original credit course will include a course fee. The Course",
    "selection Tile displays information about approved summer courses for original credit",
    "for the upcoming Academic Year: FIELD TRIP INFORMATION The Office of",
    "Academic Affairs (OAA) believes that a student\u2019s education can extend beyond the",
    "traditional classroom setting. Field trips are a valuable experience that can enrich a",
    "student\u2019s academic experience. All field trips will need approval of the OAA and",
    "should be scheduled to present the smallest interruption to the academic calendar",
    "and the student\u2019s instructional time. The general timeline for field trips are between",
    "Oct and the end of April. Fields trips will not be allowed during December, May, or",
    "June because of the consideration of Semester Exams. All field trips are considered",
    "optional endeavors and therefore students do have the choice of \u201copting out\u201d of any",
    "field trip experience without course penalty. In such cases, students must be present",
    "for the school day and attend all classes as scheduled. The teacher of the course",
    "may issue alternative work for students who choose to \u201copt out\u201d of the field trip in lieu",
    "of attending. 14 COURSE SELECTION/PLACEMENT PROCESS AND TIMELINE",
    "The course placement process is an integral part of the student\u2019s schedule creation.",
    "It requires care, discussion, and commitment from the student, his parents, and the",
    "school. Utilizing input from the student, his current teachers, his school counselors",
    "and when needed, the Office of Academic Affairs, the objective is to create a student",
    "schedule that provides the highest level of academic rigor and offers the student an",
    "opportunity for success. After final approval, a student\u2019s schedule will not be adjusted",
    "unless there is a serious educational reason. As a rule, \u201cwhat a student chooses in",
    "the course placement process in spring Semester, is what the student will take in the",
    "following semester.\u201d A student\u2019s course level placement need not be permanent for",
    "his entire Calvert Hall career. Students who wish to move up a level in a subject will",
    "need high performing academic achievement and their current course teacher\u2019s",
    "recommendation. Typically, students will not be allowed to have level changes in",
    "more than THREE courses in a single academic year. The Office of Academic Affairs",
    "will have the final say in any course movement for a student. The following timeline is",
    "a guide to the course placement process. All course placements are subject to final",
    "review and approval by the Office of Academic Affairs. Course placements may be",
    "adjusted to accommodate the proper scheduling of a student\u2019s courseload. 1.",

    "Calvert Hall, every course is college preparatory in nature. Every course is either \u00bd",
    "Credit or 1 Credit. Over an academic year, a \u00bd Credit course typically meets less",
    "often than a 1 Credit course. Two \u00bd Credit courses cannot be combined to replace a",
    "1 credit course requirement. Each academic course is classified according to one of",
    "four academic classifications. In order of increasing academic rigor, they are the",
    "following: COLLEGE PREP B LEVEL: These courses are designed with skill-building",
    "in mind. Increased attention is given to writing skills, reading skills, and study skills.",
    "The speed of each course varies, but the workload tends to be stable. Instructors will",
    "cover all essential topics in alignment with College Prep A courses. The prerequisite",
    "for enrollment in College Prep B courses is a current teacher recommendation.",
    "COLLEGE PREP A LEVEL: These courses are designed to challenge students who",
    "have adequately mastered skills. Sustained academic performance and satisfactory",
    "standardized testing results are used to support placement. The prerequisite for",
    "enrollment in College Prep A courses is a current teacher recommendation.",
    "HONORS LEVEL: These courses are designed to challenge students who have",
    "demonstrated excellence in academic performance and standardized testing results.",
    "These courses were designed for students who can navigate an increased workload.",
    "Tests, assignments, class discussions, and other assessments are crafted to help",
    "Honors Level students prepare for eventual AP Level consideration. The",
    "prerequisites for enrollment in Honors Level courses include current teacher",
    "recommendation and department approval. AP LEVEL: Students enrolled in",
    "Advanced Placement (AP) Level courses have demonstrated the highest level of",
    "academic performance and standardized test results. Students enrolled in AP Level",
    "courses must register for and complete the official AP Exam associated with the",
    "course. There is a fee for the AP Exam. The prerequisites for enrollment in AP Level",
    "courses include current teacher recommendation and department approval.",
    "ACADEMIC ACCOMODATIONS Calvert Hall students are legally eligible to receive a",
    "variety of academic accommodations. Calvert Hall will extend classroom",
    "accommodation within the reasonable capacity of our resources. To receive",
    "academic accommodation, a request for accommodation will be registered with",
    "School Counseling. The student will then need to be professionally evaluated and",
    "diagnosed with a learning disability. The current list of a list of accommodation",
    "afforded to qualified student include Preferential Seating, Extended Testing Time,",
    "Test administration in a designated testing center, no penalty for in-class spelling",
    "errors, note-taking/lecture support, use of assistive electronic device as needed.",
    "Additional unspecified accommodations can be issued on a limited basis in",
    "consultation with the School Counseling department and the Office of Academic",
    "Affairs. For the steps to be considered for accommodations, please contact the",
    "student\u2019s school counselor. 16 COURSE DESCRIPTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS",
    "FOR FRESHMEN, SOPHOMORE, JUNIOR, AND SENIOR YEARS The pages that",
    "follow contain a detailed description of the courses available and required for each",
    "academic grade level. Included will be Program exceptions and credits needed for",
    "grade promotion. When reviewing the course descriptions, students should take note",
    "of any prerequisites necessary for each course. Students should read each course",
    "description carefully and consider meeting with a course teacher or Department",
    "Chair to have a better understanding of the course requirements. In general, all",
    "courses need a recommendation by the student\u2019s current teacher. All AP courses",
    "need a current teacher\u2019s recommendation and Department approval. Department",
    "approval is by the Department Chair or the teacher of the AP course. Some courses",
    "will require a minimum grade as part of the requirement for enrollment. Students",
    "taking an AP course are required to take the AP exam. Failure to do so can prevent",
    "enrollment in future AP courses. 17 FRESHMEN YEAR - COURSES AND",
    "REQUIREMENTS (Page 1 of 2) Course Placement for Freshmen year is completed",

    "accomplished through the redemption Christ won for us. Students will learn that they",
    "share in this redemption only in and through Jesus Christ. They will also be",
    "introduced to what it means to be a disciple of Christ. The second semester will study",
    "the ways people integrate personal morality into the settings in which they find",

    "\u25cf RE: HOMEWORK POLICY",
    "\u25cf At the heart of academic success and performance is student effort and diligence.",
    "Calvert Hall\u2019s academic courses reflect an effort that blends academic rigor and",
    "ability to perform. Regular homework is an integral part of student success and each",
    "Calvert Hall course. At Calvert Hall, students are expected to completed homework,",
    "and submit it for grading. Teachers at CHC use homework as a means for assessment",
    "of student understanding as well as an impactful factor in student grades. Hence, we",
    "have updated our homework policy to reflect an expectation for student completion",
    "and submission of homework. Questions about the general policy can be directed to",
    "the Office of Academic Affairs. Individual questions about content, details, directions",
    "and deadlines of homework assignments, can be directed to the course instructor.",
    "With that in mind, please note the following:",
    "\u25cf \u00b7 Homework will be posted by the teacher on the assignment center in a timely",
    "manner in relation to the due date",
    "\u25cf \u00b7 HW that is not submitted by the due date is considered \u201cmissing\u201d and will be",

    "The History For the past one hundred seventy-nine years, Calvert Hall has been conducted",
    "by the Brothers of the Christian Schools, popularly called the Christian Brothers. They are a",
    "society of religious men having for their objective the personal sanctification of its members",
    "through the Christian education of youth. John Baptist de La Salle, a young French priest,",
    "was the founder of the Brothers. Early in his priesthood, de La Salle became concerned",
    "about the lack of educational opportunities for poor and working class boys, and he resolved",
    "to help them. He opened his first school in 1679 in the city of Rheims to provide boys with a",
    "\u201chuman and Christian education.\u201d De La Salle died in 1719, and in 1725 the Brothers of the",
    "Christian Schools were formally approved by the Church. He was proclaimed a saint by the",
    "Church in 1900. Today, over 2,800 Brothers and their associates are engaged in the mission",
    "of Christian education in over 78 countries worldwide. Lasallian education came to the",
    "United States in 1845 with the opening of a school for boys at Calvert Hall on Saratoga",
    "Street in Baltimore. The school, located in the Cathedal Parish (Basilica of the Assumption),",
    "was under the direction of Brother Francis McMullen, a native Baltimorean. One hundred",
    "pupils in that first class began a tradition that would eventually enrich the lives of many",
    "thousands of young men in the city of Baltimore and its surrounding counties. In 1890,",
    "limited space in the original building necessitated its relocation to a larger facility at",
    "Cathedral and Mulberry Streets. Decades of success as a college preparatory school, with",
    "country school pre-secondary programs and athletic facilities at Walbrook Oval, gave the",
    "\u201cOld Hall\u201d an enviable reputation. Continuous growth through the first half of the twentieth",
    "century would once again prompt the Brothers to search for a new location. Under the",
    "leadership of Brother Gabriel Cannon, Calvert Hall moved to its present location in Towson",
    "in 1960. Subsequent development of the thirty-three acre campus included the construction",
    "of the pool building in 1967 (now Carlo Crispino Center), the Marion Burk Knott Center for",
    "the Performing Arts in 1989, Paul Angelo Russo Stadium in 1999, George Young Hall in",
    "2004, Carlo Crispino Stadium in 2008, the John G. Noppinger Jr. \u201964 Student Commons in",
    "2015, the John G. Noppinger Jr. \u201864 Greenhouse in 2018, the Military Tribute Monument in",
    "2019, new turf practice fields in 2021, and a new E-Sports & Cybersecurity Arena in 2024.",
    "The breadth and strength of Calvert Hall\u2019s scholastic and extracurricular programs are",
    "reflected in its having twice been cited as an \u201cExemplary School\u201d by the United States",
    "Department of Education. At the core of this success as a Lasallian school is an experienced",
    "2 and dedicated staff who strive to put into practice the school motto, vitae via virtus, virtue is",
    "a way of life. Their dedication as educators who focus on the uniqueness of each student",
    "helps them to form leaders with a Christian perspective who will have a positive influence on",
    "the future. St. John Baptist de La Salle envisioned the Christian school as a place where the",
    "spirit of faith and an awareness of the presence of God were at the core of the educational",
    "process. For the past one hundred seventy-eight years we have sought to make that vision a",
    "reality. Mission Statement Calvert Hall College High School, a Catholic and Lasallian college",
    "preparatory school, prepares a diverse community of young men to achieve their full",
    "potential utilizing their unique talents. Through excellent academic and extracurricular",
    "programs, led by innovative and dedicated educators, our students become confident men",
    "with the ethical foundation to think independently and lead responsibly. Inspired by the faith",
    "and zeal of St. John Baptist de LaSalle, our students develop a respect for others as part of",
    "an inclusive, lifelong Calvert Hall brotherhood as Men of Intellect, Men of Faith and Men of",
    "Integrity. Philosophy Calvert Hall College is a Catholic and Lasallian school community",
    "steeped in the educational legacy of its founder, St. John Baptist de La Salle. The Brothers",
    "of the Christian Schools established Calvert Hall to provide educational opportunities to the",
    "immigrant church of Baltimore. Today, Calvert Hall reflects its core Lasallian values in its",
    "mission and practice. Calvert Hall offers an excellent academic program that stimulates and",
    "challenges its students. The Calvert Hall community values ethnic, socio-economic, and",
    "academic diversity both in its enrollment practices and in its curricular and extracurricular",
    "programing. The faculty holds students to high standards of intellectual and moral",
    "development, encouraging them to reach their potential and preparing them to face the",
    "challenges of the modern world. Essential elements of Lasallian educational practice are",
    "teaching and learning in community. The Brothers and their lay colleagues, \u201ctogether and by",
    "association,\u201d foster an educational atmosphere where the expertise of each staff member is",
    "valued. Instructed by St. John Baptist de La Salle to act as brothers to one another and to",
    "the young men entrusted to their care, the Christian Brothers have shared this educational",
    "approach with lay associates at Calvert Hall. The faculty and staff model a community that",
    "promotes a brotherhood enduring beyond graduation. The school remains faithful to its",
    "commitments as an institution of the Roman Catholic 3 Church. As St. John Baptist de La",
    "Salle envisioned, the school is a steward of that faith for every generation. Thus, Campus",
    "Ministry activities and service opportunities remain key features of Calvert Hall\u2019s Lasallian",
    "ministry, helping each student develop his relationship with God, his family and his peers.",
    "Calvert Hall focuses on the total person, preparing the student to appreciate his talents and",
    "share them with the wider community, particularly those most in need. To that end, Calvert",
    "Hall creates an environment that fosters mutual respect, enabling the student to make",
    "ethical decisions. Calvert Hall focuses on academic excellence, diversity, community, mutual",
    "respect, and brotherhood. Through caring relationships, students are called to live Lasallian",
    "values, develop their potential, respect all life and pursue the self-discipline and community",
    "action which bring spiritual, personal and academic goals to fruition. Diversity, Equity,",
    "Inclusion Statement Calvert Hall is committed to a diverse, equitable, and inclusive school",
    "community in alignment with the Lasallian Core Principles\u2014Faith in the Presence of God,",
    "Respect for All Persons, Inclusive Community, Quality Education, and Concern for the Poor",
    "and Social Justice. Faithful Lasallian work necessarily demands an institutional effort and",
    "regular renewal of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts. We endeavor to instill in our",
    "students respect, understanding, and appreciation for all individuals, regardless of race, sex,",
    "national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, socioeconomic status,",
    "age, or religion. This commitment informs our teaching, programming, and other efforts to",
    "develop brotherhood among students and alumni. By embracing the diversity of students,",
    "families, and staff, Calvert Hall seeks to develop Men of Intellect, Men of Faith, and Men of",
    "Integrity who promote justice in the world. Non-Discrimination Statement Calvert Hall does",
    "not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national, or ethnic origin, or any other",
    "category protected by law, in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies,",

    "Handbook (the \u201cHandbook\u201d) is intended as a general guide for families to the policies,",
    "procedures and personnel at Calvert Hall College High School (\u201cCalvert Hall\u201d or the",
    "\u201cSchool\u201d). Please take the time to carefully review this Handbook, including reviewing it with",
    "your son(s). It is important that families understand the School\u2019s expectations and policies,",
    "and that families know to whom they can direct their questions or concerns. Students are",
    "expected to know and understand all information in this Handbook, as well as any",
    "information or regulations issued by the School, including those in the information sheets,",
    "announcements appearing in the Daily Bulletin and on the screens in the Dining Hall or",
    "around campus. Please understand that this Handbook is intended only to highlight current",
    "policies, practices, and procedures. The policies and procedures set forth herein are",
    "intended as general guidelines\u2014specific situations may call for handling a matter in a",
    "manner different from that described herein, depending upon the particular facts and nature",
    "of the situation. However, it would be nearly impossible to review every element of every",
    "policy, or every possible scenario and outcome. Rather, this Handbook serves as a series of",
    "policy summaries to keep your family better informed. In addition, circumstances will require",
    "that the policies, practices, and procedures described in the Handbook may change from",
    "time to time. Calvert Hall reserves the right to modify or change any or all such policies,",
    "practices, and procedures in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice. The School",
    "will make every attempt to give timely notice of substantive changes in policy. This",
    "Handbook supersedes all prior policies (whether written or oral, expressed or implied) which",
    "in any way contradict with the policies herein. However, this document is not intended to",
    "supersede any individual written agreement between you and the School, or any applicable",
    "law. If you find that such a conflict or discrepancy exists, please contact Dr. Andrew Moore,",
    "Principal. This Handbook is not intended to constitute a legal contract of any kind. 7 DAILY",
    "PROCEDURES Academic Calendar Each year, Calvert Hall establishes an academic",
    "calendar which outlines the dates of academic instruction. In compliance with the Maryland",

    "instruction. Of those 174 days, four of those days have been included in case of",
    "weather-related issues to ensure that we meet the 170 day school year as required by the",
    "State of Maryland. While the School builds additional days into the academic calendar to",
    "account for unforeseen circumstances necessitating school closure, the School reserves the",
    "right to amend or modify the academic calendar as needed, including amending or modifying",
    "the mode of instruction. The School will endeavor to provide parents with reasonable notice",
    "of any such amendments or modifications. Advertising for Clubs and Activities Only Calvert",

    "Schools On days when classes are dismissed early, or on holidays when other schools are",
    "in session, students are not permitted to visit other schools without prior authorization from",
    "an administrator of the other school. 14 ACADEMICS Academic Honesty Education begins",
    "with a dialogue between student and teacher, the basis of which is an honest and truthful",
    "exchange of knowledge. In order for a teacher to respond fully and accurately to what a",
    "student knows and can do, all academic work submitted by students, whether an",
    "assignment, a test, a paper, or a lab report, must be their own work and reflect their own",
    "understanding. Anyone assisting students should be particularly careful in this regard.",
    "Student submissions should not reflect the work of others and, as warranted, should include",
    "attribution from the internet or other sources. Students\u2019 work must reflect their own efforts.",
    "Students must cite work when using another person\u2019s ideas, language, or facts. Students",
    "who have questions about their academic work should consult with their course teacher",
    "especially on assignments where student collaboration is allowed. Examples of cheating",
    "include giving or receiving information during a test, quiz, and/or class work assignment",
    "without teacher authorization; using unauthorized materials for academic work, including",
    "electronic devices to store or transmit information; copying homework; and getting questions",
    "and/or answers from a student who has already taken the test. Examples of plagiarism",
    "include, but are not limited to, submitting or presenting another person\u2019s work, words, or",
    "ideas as one\u2019s own without proper citation, including downloaded information from the",
    "internet and lab data. Examples of academic violations include giving or receiving",
    "information during an exam, a test, a quiz, and/or class work or assignments without the",
    "teacher\u2019s authorization. With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools within our",
    "educational environment, use of these tools must align and be consistent with our Academic",
    "Honesty Policy and the Acceptable Use policy for Technology. Submitted work that is",
    "unauthorized or uncited is considered a violation of our policies. An academic honesty",
    "violation will result in a failing grade on academic work of a zero. All academic honesty",
    "violations are reported to the Assistant Principal for Academic Affairs. On a first violation, an",
    "academic violation will result in a failing grade of \u201c0\u201d for the academic work. The violation will",
    "be reported by the instructor to Office of Academic Affairs (Assistant Principal) and the",
    "student\u2019s parents/guardians. The student will be expected to attend a conference with the",
    "Assistant Principal to review the Academic Violation. A subsequent violation requires the",
    "parents/guardians and student to attend a conference with the Assistant Principal for",
    "Academic Affairs to review his academic standing. In addition to the policies enumerated",
    "above, academic violations are subject to academic disciplinary action which may include",
    "but are not limited to disciplinary referrals, academic suspensions or academic expulsion. 15",
    "Academic Probation A student with two or more credit failures at the end of the first",

    "Affairs. Possible modifications include, but are not limited to mandatory acadfemic study hall,",
    "developing an academic performance improvement plan and attending performance review",
    "meetings with a designated faculty member. Addressing Academic Concerns Inevitably,",
    "questions and issues arise during the school year that parents may need to have answered",
    "and resolved. Parents\u2019 first and most important contact will be their child\u2019s school counselor.",
    "For academic matters that need further discussion, parents may wish to communicate",
    "directly with the subject teacher first and then the Department Chair. Please do not contact",
    "teachers/counselors or other members of the staff at home in the evening or on weekends.",
    "Leave a voicemail or send an email to the teacher\u2019s school accounts and teachers will strive",
    "to respond within 24 hours during the school week. Course Offerings Advanced Placement",
    "Courses: During the 2023-2024 school year, 407 students took 1040 Advanced Placement",

    "World History 16 Duel Enrollment Calvert Hall and Notre Dame Maryland University (NDMU)",
    "are offering a Dual Enrollment Partner Program for the Academic Year 2024-2025. This",
    "Dual Enrollment Program offers current Calvert Hall students the opportunity to potentially",
    "earn college credit for pre-approved Honors level courses. These selected courses were",
    "recognized for their academic rigor and approved by the Academic Dean of NDMU as",
    "opportunities to earn college credit. Therefore, an eligible Calvert Hall student will receive an",
    "official transcript from the NDMU outlining the college credit earned which in turn may be",
    "transferable to any destination college institution of the student\u2019s choice. The official",
    "transcript would be accessible by students at the end of the academic year. This program is",
    "for current courses and students ONLY and is not retroactive. Consequently, students who",
    "have taken the course previously are NOT eligible to receive NDMU credit for that course.",

    "Support Program is to build skills and strategies in organization, time management, and",
    "study strategies in order to increase students\u2019 independence and success in high school,",
    "college, and beyond. Students accepted into this program meet with a learning specialist for",
    "one period every other day in groups of three to five. A student in this program may have a",
    "diagnosed learning difference such as ADHD or Executive Function Disorder or may simply",
    "want additional instruction to improve in these areas. The Academic Support Specialist is",
    "Ms. Elizabeth Moore. LaSalle Program The LaSalle Program serves a group of",
    "college-bound students with identified language learning difficulties. In addition to their",
    "regularly scheduled classes, LaSalle students meet one period each day with their learning",
    "specialist. The program focuses on skills and strategies rather than content with the goal of",
    "remediating weak reading and writing skills while increasing the student\u2019s understanding of",
    "his learning strengths and needs as he becomes his own advocate. The students are fully",
    "integrated into the academic program of the school. The Director of the LaSalle Program is",
    "Mrs. Jennifer Healy. Leadership Institute at Calvert Hall Any Calvert Hall student can earn a",
    "certificate in leadership at graduation by completing three years (10th \u2013 12th grades) of a",
    "program that includes leadership seminars, attendance at the 18 Leadership Dinner Speaker",
    "Series, participation in field trips, retreat experiences, and courses on both the junior and",
    "senior levels. A critical piece of this program will include participation in clubs and activities",
    "throughout their time at Calvert Hall as well as the completion of a Leadership Practicum",
    "experience that will put leadership skills into practice. STEM Program As an integrated",
    "educational and experiential program of academics and activities, our program is designed",
    "to encourage students as they develop the skills of problem-solving, discovery, and",
    "investigative learning. Students transfer formal classroom experiences into dynamic and",
    "meaningful activities outside of the classroom in the practical application of STEM in the 21st",
    "century. The Director of the STEM Program is Mr. Trey Hoos. Exams Semester exams are",
    "usually given in December and June (in May for seniors). Semester exams count for 15% of",
    "the semester grade. Students are required to take their semester exams on the day",
    "indicated unless illness prevents a student from attending school. In this case, the school",
    "must be notified by 9:30 a.m. and a doctor\u2019s note is required upon returning to school.",
    "Students who miss an exam without a note from a doctor can be penalized to to 20% of the",
    "exam grade. Semester exams must be given in all full credit subject areas except physical",
    "education. Students taking Advanced Placement courses do not take spring semester",
    "exams in those courses. Senior teachers may exempt individual seniors who have a 90% or",
    "higher average for their final grade from the final semester exam of a course. Graduation",
    "Requirements n Seniors who fail an academic subject at the end of the senior year may",

    "selection to this chapter must be members of the sophomore or junior class, have been",
    "enrolled for at least one semester at Calvert Hall, and have a minimum cumulative",
    "un-weighted grade point average of 90.0% or a minimum cumulative weighted grade point",

    "school rule per year, and by receiving positive teacher evaluations. Physical Education",
    "Classes All students must participate in physical education classes according to their",
    "schedule. In the event a student needs to be excused from physical education, a note from a",
    "parent must be presented at the Nurse\u2019s Office before homeroom. If the excuse is for an",
    "extended period of time, a note from a physician must be presented to the school Nurse and",
    "to the Office of Academic Affairs for approval. Students who do not take physical education",
    "class cannot participate in athletics during that time. Promotion Requirements Students must",
    "receive a passing grade in all subjects. A unit of credit will be awarded for the satisfactory",
    "completion of the school\u2019s prescribed curriculum for each course. Students who have less",
    "than three credit failures must remove these failures in an approved summer program in",

    "social studies, a minimum of three years of mathematics and laboratory science, two years",
    "of foreign language and physical education, three elective courses, one course in the fine",
    "arts, and one course in computer applications/presentation skills. Reports Progress reports",
    "are usually issued in November and March. Grades on the progress report are not quarterly",
    "grades but simply indicators of work being performed to date. Semester grade report cards",
    "are issued in January and June. The semester grade in each subject represents the",
    "cumulative average of all work done throughout the semester including the student\u2019s",
    "achievement on the semester exam. A student\u2019s final grade for the year is determined by",
    "averaging the grades on the two Semester Grade Reports except for single semester",
    "courses which must be passed independently. Faculty members, with the approval of the",
    "Office of Academic Affairs, 21 may override the numerical average of the semester grade in",
    "determining a final grade. Parents and students can access grades through OnCampus.",
    "Parents are expected to verify their receipt on-line for academic reports and report cards.",

    "22 STUDENT CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINE The following regulations are intended to",
    "ensure an environment which is conducive to learning and is characterized by responsible",
    "behavior, mutual respect and cooperation among all members of the Calvert Hall community.",
    "Our code of conduct applies to any student who is on school property, in attendance at",
    "school, at any school-sponsored event, or whose conduct at any other time or place has an",
    "effect on maintaining school order and discipline, protecting the safety and welfare of others,",
    "or damaging the reputation of the school. To that end, students are responsible for the",
    "manner in which they represent themselves and Calvert Hall at all times. A student who",
    "brings discredit to himself and the school through public misconduct will be subject to",
    "disciplinary action when the matter is brought to the attention of the school administration. If",
    "a student violates a policy or rule, we encourage the student to voluntarily report their",
    "behavior. When a student is forthcoming about their involvement in a situation, their honesty",
    "will be taken into account, when possible, in determining the consequence they receive.",
    "Conversely, if a student attempts to conceal their actions, their dishonesty will be considered",
    "when determining the consequence. Maintaining a healthy school environment conducive to",
    "learning requires each member of the community to be involved and includes reporting",
    "concerns about other\u2019s behavior. While we understand that reporting on fellow students\u2019",
    "behavior can be difficult, we need everyone\u2019s help in ensuring that our school is a safe place.",
    "Even if a student believes that the administration is aware of an issue, that student should",
    "still report what they know. It is better to receive all the information so that the best solution",
    "can be reached. As in all matters involving student conduct, Calvert Hall reserves the right to",
    "suspend or expel any student whose behavior is, in the School\u2019s judgment, a threat to the",
    "well-being and safety of the School community, whether or not it violates a specifically stated",
    "rule. Disciplinary Policies General Detention: A student may be assigned to this detention for",
    "any behavior that violates school regulations, for other disciplinary problems referred to the",
    "Dean of Students, or for being late to class or school. General detention begins five minutes",
    "after dismissal and is held for forty minutes. If a student is late for detention he will receive",
    "an additional day, unless he presents a note from the teacher who detained him. No student",
    "may be excused from general detention except by the Dean of Students. Accumulated",
    "detentions (5) will result in a student being assigned to Saturday detention 9:00 a.m. - noon.",
    "Students receiving numerous detentions may be ineligible to participate in or attend school",
    "activities. 23 Private Detention: A private detention is issued when a student has violated a",
    "teacher\u2019s policies. A student is then to report to the teacher at the indicated time and place. If",
    "a student also has General Detention at that time, he should ask the teacher for a note to be",
    "given to the Dean of Students indicating the reason for his lateness to or absence from",
    "General Detention. Private detention takes precedence over general detention. Students",
    "Who Are Arrested: If a student is arrested, the School, in its sole discretion, may take",
    "disciplinary action or other steps that it deems appropriate, depending on the nature of the",
    "alleged crime, the potential threat to the safety of members of the school community, or the",
    "timeline and outcomes of an investigation. Suspensions/Expulsions: Repeated or more",
    "serious infractions of the School\u2019s expectations for student conduct may result in a",
    "suspension or expulsion. In the event that a student violates a school regulation that involves",
    "suspension or the possibility of dismissal from school the following procedures are followed.",
    "n Suspension: Parents are notified of a suspension by the Dean of Students and an",
    "appointment is scheduled for them to come to school to discuss the situation. A parent must",
    "sign a letter acknowledging the suspension and its disciplinary consequences. His/her son",
    "cannot be re-admitted to class if this is not done in a timely manner. A student who is",
    "suspended may, at the discretion of the Dean of Students/Discipline Committee, be ineligible",
    "to participate in or attend school activities, such as athletics or senior prom. A student",
    "receiving a second suspension during the course of his four years may be subject to",
    "expulsion. The Dean of Students will contact the parents to inform them of the",
    "circumstances of the second suspension. n Expulsion: Parents are notified of their son\u2019s",
    "suspension/disciplinary situation and may be asked to pick him up from school, if",
    "appropriate. The Discipline Committee, composed of the Dean of Students, the Assistant",
    "Principal for Academic Affairs, the Director of Student Activities then meets to review the",
    "incident. The Committee then presents the information on the incident and their",
    "recommendation to the Principal. The Principal will take the Discipline Committee\u2019s",
    "recommendation into consideration, but the Principal will make the final disciplinary decision.",
    "The Dean of Students will communicate the final decision to parents and the Discipline",
    "Committee. While parents may meet with the Principal to discuss the decision, the",
    "Principal\u2019s decision is final. At the end of the school year, the records of students who have",
    "had serious disciplinary infractions are reviewed by the Discipline Committee. Students who,",
    "in the judgment of the 24 Committee, do not appear to be benefitting from the total",
    "educational program at Calvert Hall may be asked to withdraw from school at that time.",
    "Expectations for Student Conduct Academic Integrity: The School has outlined its",
    "expectations for academic integrity. Where a student\u2019s behavior violates those expectations,",
    "the School reserves the right to take appropriate disciplinary action. Bullying: Bullying is",
    "defined as the use of a written, verbal or electronic expression or a physical act or gesture,",
    "or any combination thereof, by one or more students directed at a target that: (a) causes",
    "physical or emotional harm to the student or damage to the student\u2019s property; (b) places the",
    "student in reasonable fear of harm to the student\u2019s self or damage to the student\u2019s property;",
    "(c) creates a hostile environment at School for the student; (d) infringes on the rights of the",
    "student at School; or (e) materially and substantially disrupts the educational process or the",
    "orderly operations of the School. Cyber Bullying: Cyber bullying is a form of bullying that",
    "makes use of electronic technology, including, but not limited to, cell phones and laptops, as",
    "well as communication tools including social media sites, text messages, chat, and other",
    "websites. Bullying behavior can involve posting rumors about a person, threats, sexual",
    "remarks, disclosing an individual\u2019s personal information without their express permission, or",
    "using derogatory speech. If a student\u2019s behavior violates the expectations regarding",
    "bullying/cyber bullying, the school reserves the right to take the appropriate disciplinary",
    "action. Gambling: All forms of gambling are prohibited. Harassment: Harassment is a form of",
    "discrimination and is unacceptable behavior. Harassment is defined as verbal or physical",
    "conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of",
    "his/her race, color, national origin, religion, age, disability or handicap that has the purpose",
    "or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment which interferes with an",
    "individual\u2019s performance or educational opportunities and disrupts the school environment.",
    "Harassment can take many forms. Examples include limiting opportunities to participate in",
    "certain clubs, teams, or activities based on certain characteristics, as well as slurs, jokes,",
    "statements, remarks, questions, gestures, pictures, emails, texts, or cartoons regarding a",
    "legally protected status that are derogatory or demeaning to an individual\u2019s or group\u2019s",
    "characteristics or that promote stereotypes. Harassment also includes sexual harassment",
    "(as 25 defined below).All incidents of harassment should be reported to a member of the",
    "counseling department or administration. The incident will be investigated and appropriate",
    "remedies will be imposed. Hazing: Hazing is defined as any action taken or situation",
    "created, whether on or off the School\u2019s premises, that is harmful or potentially harmful to an",
    "individual\u2019s physical, emotional, or psychological well-being, regardless of an individual\u2019s",
    "willingness to participate or its bearing on the individual\u2019s membership status on a team or",
    "club. Such activities and situations include, but are not limited to: whipping, beating,",
    "branding, forced calisthenics, exposure to the weather, forced consumption of any food,",
    "liquor, beverage, drug, or other substance, or any brutal treatment or forced physical activity",
    "which is likely to adversely affect the physical, emotional, or psychological health or safety of",
    "a student or any other person. Both individuals and groups may be held accountable for",
    "violating these expectations under this policy. The action of even one member of a group",
    "may result in both the individual and the group being held responsible and subject to",
    "disciplinary proceedings. Inappropriate Language: Abusive, foul, threatening or harassing",
    "language is an inappropriate way to communicate with others and will not be tolerated.",
    "Hateful speech can include the use of song lyrics, gestures, or symbols of any kind meant to",
    "denigrate an individual or group and will not be tolerated. Reckless Driving: Students driving",
    "to and from school and school activities are expected to obey all speed limits and exercise",
    "courtesy toward pedestrians and other drivers. Exceeding speed limits or driving recklessly",
    "are considered serious violations, especially because of the residential nature of the",
    "neighborhood and the proximity of three schools. Retaliation: Retaliation is any form of",
    "intimidation, reprisal or harassment directed against a student who reports misconduct",
    "(including, but not limited to, bullying, harassment, discrimination, hazing, sexual assault or",
    "sexual harassment), provides information during an investigation, or witnesses and/or has",
    "reliable information about misconduct. Sexual Assault: Sexual assault occurs when a person",
    "is forced or coerced into sexual activity without giving consent. Sexual activity includes, but",
    "is not limited to, rape (here defined as forced vaginal, anal, or oral penetration), as well as",
    "groping, touching or fondling, either directly or through the clothing of another\u2019s intimate",
    "areas. Sexual Harassment: Sexual harassment is a type of harassment (as defined above).",
    "Sexual harassment includes unwilling and unwanted sexual attention, regardless of gender,",
    "from anyone with whom a person may interact in the course of attending the School or being",
    "26 present at School-sponsored activities. Examples of behavior that may constitute sexual",
    "harassment include (regardless of whether the intent or consequence of such behavior is to",
    "make the target feel uncomfortable): (a) offensive body language (staring and/or leering at a",
    "person\u2019s body or standing/brushing too close); (b) offensive or unwanted sexual comments,",
    "abuse, jokes, insults, delivered orally or in writing; (c) derogatory or pornographic posters,",
    "cartoons or drawings; (d) pressure for sexual activity (such as hazing or threats as well as",
    "repeated requests after rejections); (e) offering favors or benefits in exchange for sexual",
    "acts, or threatening mistreatment if one does not engage in sexual acts; and (f) offensive or",
    "unwelcome physical advances (including kissing, hugging, pinching, grabbing, groping,",
    "\u201cplayful\u201d slapping, etc.). If a student\u2019s behavior violates the expectations regarding retaliation",
    "or sexual assault/ harassment, the school reserves the right to take appropriate disciplinary",
    "action. Tobacco, Drugs and Alcohol: A student may not buy, sell, possess, share, distribute,",
    "or use alcohol or other unauthorized drugs or substances, including tobacco and",
    "tobacco-related products (including e-cigarettes and vaping), and/or any paraphernalia",
    "associated with the use of alcohol, unauthorized drugs or substances. Further, a student",
    "may not intentionally misuse products that can act as inhalants, while enrolled at the School.",
    "This prohibition includes the use of medications, both prescription and over-the-counter, in",
    "any manner other than as prescribed or intended by the manufacturer. The school reserves",
    "the right, upon parent notification, to require the student to take an in-school drug/alcohol",
    "test. Results of the test may require a student to attend/seek treatment and further testing, or",
    "a student may be suspended/expelled as a result of the test. Violation of the drug/alcohol",
    "regulation on the occasion of the Senior Prom may incur immediate suspension/ expulsion",
    "with the forfeiture of all rights to participate in commencement exercises. Unauthorized",
    "Photos and Videos: Taking photos, recordings, or videos of faculty, staff, or students without",
    "their expressed permission is forbidden. Permission is not required for public events such as",
    "athletic competitions or plays. School assemblies are not public events. Weapons: In order",
    "to maintain a safe atmosphere conducive to learning, Calvert Hall expressly forbids the",
    "possession or use on campus or at any school related event of any weapon, instrument, or",
    "device that could be used to harm another or oneself; this prohibition includes, but is not",
    "limited to, firearms, knives, fireworks, knuckles, etc. In addition, propelling any projectile at a",
    "motor vehicle, an unwilling or unsuspecting person, or a building is considered reckless",
    "behavior and is also prohibited by the School. 27 ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY FOR",
    "TECHNOLOGY Calvert Hall is committed to cultivating in each student an active pursuit of",
    "academic excellence and intellectual development. Recognizing that educational excellence",
    "depends upon keeping abreast of the latest technology, Calvert Hall has endeavored to",
    "expand technological resources to serve the entire school community. The use of technology",
    "is intended to support administrative, academic and other school related work. It is",
    "understood that use of technology should be consistent with both the educational and moral",
    "objectives of Calvert Hall. This policy serves to outline the expected standards of behavior",
    "by all users of technological equipment, computers and networks within the school. In",
    "accordance with the school\u2019s general philosophy, use of technology at Calvert Hall implies",
    "agreement with the principles specifically outlined in this policy and with the broader",
    "concepts of ethical, legal, and responsible use. Whether physically on campus or off",
    "campus, whether during the school day or at night, on vacation or at any other time while",
    "enrolled at the School, whether linked to the School\u2019s network from in school or from a",
    "remote location or not at all, or using their own personal computer or communication device",
    "on or off campus, students are expected to comply with this Acceptable Use Policy and any",
    "other applicable policies and procedures as long as they are enrolled at the School, as set",
    "forth in this Handbook and as further described below. The School has explicit guidelines for",
    "using computers and other electronic devices and services, both on and off campus, using",
    "the School\u2019s network, and accessing the internet. Overall, students should understand that",
    "the guidelines and expectations for in-person interactions and behavior are equally",
    "applicable to interactions and behavior while using computers and other electronic devices.",
    "Students should understand that they have no expectation of privacy in the use of computers",
    "and other electronic devices while using the School\u2019s network. The School may monitor the",
    "activity and contents (including email, documents, and other files) of computers and",
    "school-managed online accounts on campus and/or connected to the School\u2019s network, to",
    "ensure student safety and that the guidelines are being followed. The examples below",
    "represent examples of appropriate and inappropriate behavior, but are not an all-inclusive",
    "list: Students may: n Use technology for School work or class projects and assignments, at",
    "the teacher\u2019s discretion; n Access the internet with teacher permission to enrich learning",
    "related to School work; and n Use technology in ways directed by the teacher. 28 Students",
    "may not: n Post personal information about themselves or other people on the School\u2019s",
    "network; n Access or try to access network resources not intended for them; n Share their",
    "passwords with anyone; n Alter electronic communications to hide their identity or",
    "impersonate another person; n Use inappropriate language or images in email, web pages,",
    "videos, or social networking sites; n Be disrespectful by communicating or posting",
    "derogatory or false material (images, video, etc.) via email, social networking sites, live chat,",
    "web page, or any other method; n Engage in cyber-bullying, harassment, or sexting, in",
    "violation of the School\u2019s policies as stated in this Handbook; n Access inappropriate",
    "information on the internet such as (but not restricted to) sites that bypass filtering, promote",
    "hate or violence, or sites with sexually explicit or graphic, pornographic, or obscene material;",
    "n Printed or electronic information must follow all copyright, trademark, patent and other laws",
    "governing intellectual property. Misuse of generative AI or plagarizing content is strictly",
    "prohibited. n Install or download software onto School computers from the internet, home, or",
    "by any other means; they may not remove network cables, keyboards or any other",
    "components unless expressly permitted by the School; n Create or use a mobile hotspot on",
    "the School campus; n Remove any School-owned computer equipment from the School",
    "without express permission; n Store personal files on the network, except in their own",
    "network user account; any information that a student leaves on a School-owned device may",
    "be deleted at any time, with or without notice; n Disclose confidential or proprietary",
    "information related to the School, make public remarks that defame or disparage the School,",
    "its employees, its students or its interests, or that recklessly disregard or distort the truth of",
    "the matters commented on; n Access, change, delete, read, or copy any file, program, or",
    "account that belongs to someone else without permission; n Intentionally vandalize, steal, or",
    "cause harm to any School-owned equipment; n Deliberately disrupt or attempt to disrupt the",
    "software or hardware of the School network; n Be \u201cfriends\u201d with, or otherwise directly",
    "connect to via online networks and services, any School employee on any social networking",
    "site that is not used primarily for educational 29 purposes. If students are contacted by a",
    "School employee via non-School channels for non-educational purposes, they should",
    "immediately notify the student\u2019s counselor. Violations of computing and network policy may",
    "result in suspension/dismissal or revocation of privileges, and further disciplinary actions by",
    "the administration. The school administration reserves the right to make the final decision as",
    "to appropriateness of use. Bring Your Own Device Requirements All students are required to",
    "bring a device to school which runs a modern, supported Operation System such as",
    "Windows 10, MAC OSX, IOS, etc. All devices must also run a modern, fully featured web",
    "browser, productivity suite and note taking software (Microsoft Office, PowerPoint, etc.), be",
    "Wi-Fi enabled, have a functioning webcam, microphone, speakers, headphones, have a",
    "battery life which will last throughout the school day, and power up in less than 90 seconds.",
    "Additionally, all screen sizes must be 7\u2019\u2019 or larger and include a physical keyboard to",
    "facilitate typing. We recommend that all devices have a protective case. Office 365 is",
    "available free of charge to all CHC students. Chromebooks are not recommended as a",
    "device, because they do not run the full Microsoft Office Suite. Cell phones are not",
    "considered an acceptable device. Most other computers on the market comply with the",
    "guidelines listed above. Students who experience any technology issues can always stop",
    "into the library (on the plaza level of George Young Hall) for technology assistance. Please",
    "note that one of the most frequent laptop issues occurs when a student does not properly",
    "charge his device. Students will need to be responsible for keeping their device charged and",
    "using the charging station in the dining hall or library when necessary. A limited number of",
    "USB-C power cords are available for same day borrowing. Failure to return the power cord",
    "on the same day will result in a $5 fee per day. CHC recommends each student purchase an",
    "auxiliary power cord for their device, if possible. Laptop Loan Policy: If a student\u2019s laptop",
    "malfunctions, dies, or becomes unusable, students are able to obtain a loaner Calvert Hall",
    "laptop. The general loaner laptop fee is $5 per calendar day. In an effort to work with",
    "students, the loaner fee is waived for up to 15 days ($75) with documented proof of",
    "damage/repair to the student\u2019s personal device. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to care for",
    "the loaner device (and power adapter). Any damage or loss to the CHC equipment is the",
    "responsibility of the student. 30 STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS AND ACTIVITIES Student",

    "33 ATHLETICS Purpose Calvert Hall College believes that participation in athletics, both as",
    "a player and as a spectator, is an integral part of the student\u2019s educational experience. The",
    "Athletic Program teaches such skills and values as the ability to think and function as a",
    "member of a team, sportsmanship, competition, the benefits of a healthy body,",
    "self-discipline, emotional maturity, respect for others, and the importance of a system of",
    "morals. Calvert Hall Athletics provides experiences that will help students develop physically,",
    "mentally, and emotionally. The element of competition and winning, though it exists, is",
    "controlled in that it does not determine the nature of the program. Students are encouraged",
    "to win, but the principles of good sportsmanship prevail at all times to enhance the",
    "educational values of the contest. Athletic Teams Fall Season Football - Varsity, Junior",

    "program provides an opportunity for junior and senior peer educators to serve as big",
    "brothers to the freshmen by teaching effective life skills that will lead to safe, positive",
    "decisions. College counselors support students and families through the college admission",
    "process by teaching college advising classes, individual student and parent meetings along",
    "with group presentations for parents. Various aspects of the college admission process are",
    "highlighted including admissions, standardized testing, financial aid, athletic recruitment, and",
    "transitioning to life after high school. The department\u2019s programming includes the following",
    "events: October Testing Day, Fall College Fair, and several informational college planning",
    "meetings for parents of Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors. The School Counseling",
    "Department is authorized to release students\u2019 transcripts to college/ university admissions",
    "departments, NCAA coaches, and scholarship granting organizations unless advised in",
    "writing to the contrary by a student\u2019s parent or legal guardian. Transcript requests should be",
    "directed to student\u2019s college counselor. 37 Accommodations: Consistent with its policy",
    "prohibiting discrimination, Calvert Hall is committed to ensuring that students with disabilities",
    "are provided with equal access to its programs. The School will provide accommodations",
    "and modifications to ensure a disabled student has equal access to the School\u2019s services,",
    "provided that they do not fundamentally alter the School\u2019s educational programs or Mission.",
    "Requests for accommodations should be addressed to the student\u2019s counselor. When",
    "evaluating a request for an accommodation, Calvert Hall will collect all information relevant",
    "to determine whether the School can appropriately meet the student\u2019s needs. This",
    "information may include, without limitation, aptitude and achievement tests, physicians\u2019",
    "statements, teacher recommendations, and information regarding the student\u2019s physical",
    "condition, adaptive behavior, or social or cultural background. The School, in conjunction",
    "with the student\u2019s parents, will determine which educational strategies and accommodations",
    "can be implemented and will implement an individual plan with the student, parents, faculty,",
    "and administration, utilizing the accommodations available at Calvert Hall. Accommodations",
    "plans shall be reviewed and updated, if necessary, on a periodic basis. If it becomes evident",
    "that a student is not meeting the school\u2019s academic or behavioral expectations with the",
    "agreed support and modifications in place, then the parents will be advised that the student",
    "requires placement in a different educational setting which is fully appropriate to the",
    "particular needs of the child. College Board School Code: Calvert Hall\u2019s College Board",
    "School Code is 210055. Office Procedure: Counselors are available to help students. If a",
    "student wishes to see a school or college counselor, he should make an appointment during",
    "unscheduled periods. Students seeking to attend a college admission visit during the school",
    "day may not be absent from class unless granted prior written permission of the teacher.",
    "Special Circumstances: It is a school policy that, once a student has been judged to be in",
    "serious emotional distress (suicidal ideation, severe depression, other behavioral disorders,",
    "etc.) and the parents have been notified of this condition, the principal may require that the",
    "student\u2019s return to school be contingent upon an appropriate evaluation by a qualified",
    "professional. The professional will assess the student\u2019s capacity to return to school without",
    "jeopardizing the safety of himself or others. Furthermore, the professional will be asked to",
    "provide the school with a prognosis, recommendation, and a projected treatment plan.",
    "Campus Ministry Campus Ministry is a student-based program in the tradition of St. John",
    "Baptist de La Salle, 38 which promotes the dignity of each member of the school community",
    "by sharing and living out the principles and values shared in the gospel message. The",
    "Campus Ministry Office is a place for any student, giving him the opportunity to become",
    "involved in many faith-based programs at The Hall. The goal of Campus Ministry is to help",
    "young people grow in their relationship with God and provide opportunities for young people",
    "to minister to each other. School-wide masses, Lenten/Advent and team prayer",
    "opportunities, service trips and projects, food and clothing drives, music ministry and peer",
    "ministry are all coordinated through the Campus Ministry Office. Chapel: Calvert Hall has",
    "placed its Chapel under the protection of Our Lady of the Star. Masses every first Friday of",
    "the month, daily communion services, and other liturgical opportunities are celebrated",
    "regularly in this sacred space. Students are encouraged to participate whenever their",
    "schedule permits. Teachers are likewise encouraged to bring their classes to the chapel",
    "periodically in order to emphasize our connectedness with the Lord. Liturgy and Prayer: The",
    "liturgical and prayer lives of our students are a key component to our Campus Ministry",
    "Program. The school community gathers several times throughout the year on special",
    "occasions and holy days of obligation for Mass. Students are involved in all aspects of liturgy",
    "from lectors, to Eucharistic Ministers, to music ministers, to ushers and technology aides.",
    "The Liturgy Band provides student-led music at masses and prayer services. During Lent",
    "students can participate in small group faith sharing, special service projects, and adoration",
    "and reconciliation throughout their five week Lenten journey. Retreats: Calvert Hall believes",
    "that retreats are an essential part of the growth and development of our students. Every",
    "student participates in a retreat during each of his four years at The Hall. The overnight",
    "freshman retreat helps our newest students understand what it means to be a Lasallian by",
    "focusing on the core values of faith, service, and community. Sophomore retreat focuses on",
    "social action, as each sophomore participates in a day of service. Junior retreat focuses on",
    "identity development and their relationship with others during a two-day, one-night overnight",
    "at the River Valley Ranch in Manchester, MD. The junior retreat is led by junior and senior",
    "peer ministers as well as the Campus Ministry team. The senior retreat is a three-day,",
    "two-night retreat at the River Valley Ranch. During this capstone retreat, students focus on",
    "the life lessons of their high school careers and are challenged to think about their futures",
    "beyond The Hall. Service: Calvert Hall seeks to prepare students to live as Christian leaders",
    "cultivating within them a genuine concern for the poor. Students are encouraged to become",
    "part of the extensive service program that is offered through the Campus Ministry Office.",
    "Students can serve at 39 a variety of agencies such as Sarah\u2019s Hope Shelter, the Gallagher",
    "Center, Helping Up Mission, Herring Run Head Start, Beans and Bread, Our Daily Bread,",
    "and more. Many students become involved in weekly or monthly projects throughout their",
    "four years. Students have the opportunity to go on school-sponsored immersion trips each",
    "year and, in the past, have traveled to places like Baltimore, Belize, Camden, Chicago, Haiti,",
    "Miami, Montana, New Orleans, and the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Students are also",
    "responsible for the success of many school drives such as the Mission Drive, Thanksgiving",
    "Food Drive, and the Adopt-A-Family project. 40 STUDENT HEALTH Allergy Awareness",
    "Calvert Hall is committed to working with families, students and providers to provide a safe",
    "and healthy environment. Although our campus is not an \u201callergy-free\u201d environment, we",
    "strive to keep our students as safe as possible through several measures. Upon receiving",
    "information regarding a severe allergy, as documented by a health care provider, a plan will",
    "be developed to address emergency treatment needs, the roles and responsibilities of the",
    "student and family, as well as ongoing education of the Calvert Hall community. Parents and",
    "guardians are encouraged to check the menu located on the Calvert Hall website and the",
    "Touch of SAGE App. or contact our Food Services Director for further discussion of our",
    "menu options. Epinephrine Policy Calvert Hall College High School has adopted a policy",
    "allowing the availability of stock epinephrine in the health suite for use in the event of an",
    "anaphylactic emergency. This epinephrine is for emergency use during normal school days",
    "and is not dependent on allergy history. It is not available outside of normal school hours or",
    "on field trips. Students with a known history of severe allergies are still expected to maintain",
    "emergency action plans, medical orders, and their own supply of Epinephrine Autoinjectors",
    "that they self-carry and/or store in the Health Suite. Communicable Illness Communicable",
    "conditions, such as strep, flu, chicken pox, impetigo, pertussis, ringworm, and COVID-19",
    "should be immediately reported to the school nurse. The School may exclude any student",
    "from school who has a communicable illness or has been exposed to an infected person if",
    "the School determines that such exclusion is appropriate for the welfare of the student who",
    "is excluded from School and/or the welfare of other students or employees at the School. In",
    "reaching the decision to exclude a student from the School, the School may consult with",
    "appropriate medical professionals and/or the Department of Health. In order to return to",
    "School, students who have been excluded from School for health reasons must submit a",
    "physician\u2019s certification that the student may return to School without risk to self or to others.",
    "If and when appropriate, the School will disseminate information to students and families",
    "regarding campus health and safety issues through regular internal communication",
    "channels. For example, the School may provide families with information about the nature",
    "and spread of communicable illnesses, including symptoms and signs to watch for, as well",
    "as required steps 41 to be taken in the event of an epidemic or outbreak. We encourage all",
    "parents and guardians to contact medical professionals with any questions or concerns",
    "about communicable illnesses or immunization issues. Immunizations The School fully",
    "complies with Maryland Laws with regard to student vaccinations (requiring DTaP \u2013 3 doses;",
    "Tdap \u2013 1 dose; Polio \u2013 3 doses; MMR \u2013 2 doses; Varicella \u2013 2 doses; Hepatitis \u2013 3 doses;",
    "Meningococcal \u2013 1 dose) and further may require additional vaccinations as a matter of",
    "School policy. Consistent with the same, the School will only accept verifiable medical",
    "exemptions, indicating which immunization(s) is/are medically contraindicated with specific",
    "reason(s), and signed off by a Primary Care Provider who has been regularly seeing the",
    "student. No other exemptions are considered. Medical Leave of Absence In cases of serious",
    "illness, bodily injury, or an emotional or psychological condition that prevents a student from",
    "engaging in the life and work of school, a medical leave from school may be appropriate.",
    "Decisions regarding medical leave, or reinstating a student who has been on leave, rest with",
    "the senior administrators in consultation with the school nurse and/or the school counselor.",
    "Decisions regarding such leave will be guided by the principal. The goal of a medical leave:",
    "to give the student the opportunity to regain health and thereby function consistently,",
    "productively, and safely at School. In the absence of a treatment plan that, in the School\u2019s",
    "opinion, will achieve these goals, the School may decline to grant a medical leave request,",
    "and instead require the student to withdraw. A student\u2019s family may request medical leave.",
    "The School requires that any request for medical leave be accompanied by sufficient",
    "supporting documentation (as determined by the School in its sole discretion) to allow the",
    "School to evaluate the leave request, including, but not limited to, at least the following",
    "information: (a) a recommendation from the student\u2019s treating medical professionals that the",
    "student would benefit from taking a medical leave; (b) a description of how the student\u2019s",
    "medical condition limits the student\u2019s ability to participate in required academic or",
    "extracurricular activities; (c) the plan for treatment of the student\u2019s medical condition; and (d)",
    "an anticipated date for the student\u2019s return. To return to School from a medical leave, a",
    "student must provide a thorough, written professional evaluation of the student\u2019s current",
    "mental health and/or medical condition from the physician, psychiatrist, or other licensed",
    "professional who treated the student during the medical leave. The School may require",
    "additional evaluation by a physician or mental health consultant of its choosing. 42",
    "Medication All daily or as needed medications must be given to the School Nurse in a",
    "labeled prescription bottle accompanied by a Prescription Medication Form from a provider.",
    "When ordered and with permission from the student\u2019s parent and provider, rescue inhalers",
    "and epinephrine auto-injectors may be carried by the student. Otherwise, students are not",
    "allowed to carry any form of medication with them in school. An Over-the-Counter",
    "Medication Form must be on file online, in Magnus Health, to allow the Nurse to give the",
    "student over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol or Tums. Students who are ill should",
    "see the Nurse. The Nurse will then call a parent to discuss a student\u2019s health or if a student",
    "should go home. Student Illness Parents of students who are ill are encouraged to keep their",
    "student home, to allow the student to recover and to prevent the risk of spreading disease to",
    "the greater school community. Parents of students who become sick during the day will be",
    "notified by telephone. Emergency Information and Authorization In order to assist the School",
    "in attending to the health and safety of Students, the school uses Magnus Health for",
    "maintaining health records. Parents are required to use Magnus Health and to provide the",
    "School with a full and complete description of any health conditions(s) or medical",
    "restriction(s) that the Student may have. The school will make every reasonable attempt to",
    "contact Parents or another emergency contact in the event of a medical emergency. In the",
    "event of an emergency, the school employees, agents and chaperones (e.g. trainers, school",
    "nurses, team physician) many accompany the Student to a medical facility, authorize",
    "treatment of the Student by licensed medical personnel, take any other actions reasonably",
    "necessary to treat the Student in the event of a medical emergency and to use and/or",
    "disclose pertinent health information for the treatment of any injury or health condition that",
    "may arise at the School or during School-related activities. Parents are financially",
    "responsible for any cost incurred with the treatment of the Student. Any medical insurance",
    "that covers the Student will be the primary insurance coverage for any such treatment.",
    "COVID-19 While the country has made progress in controlling COVID-19, breakthrough",
    "infections and the emergence of new variants remind us that we must remain vigilant and",
    "keep our community safe. The School reserves the right to modify or change any or all such",
    "policies, practices, and procedures in whole or part, at any time, with or without notice. This",
    "includes 43 the ability to alter the school year schedule, the academic program (including",
    "distance learning), and the co-curricular schedule and breadth of activities. Students will be",
    "required to follow all safety protocols implemented by the School including masking and",
    "proper hygiene. The School respects the right to privacy of any student who has a",
    "communicable disease, including COVID-19. All student records or information regarding",
    "communicable diseases will be confidentially maintained by the School Nurse. The student\u2019s",
    "medical condition will be disclosed only to the extent necessary to minimize the health risks",
    "to classmates, employees, and the greater School community. Despite the safety policies",
    "and protocols in place to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 and other communicable",
    "diseases, there are inherent risks that students and their families may become infected/ill",
    "due to the student\u2019s participation at School. By allowing their child(ren) to come to campus,",
    "parents understand, acknowledge, and voluntarily assume these risks on behalf of",
    "themselves and the student(s). 44 WHO\u2019S WHO AT CALVERT HALL Board of Trustees \u2013",

    "Since 2006, Calvert Hall has partnered with First Financial Federal Credit Union to bring",
    "Campus Debit Card services to the Calvert Hall campus. First Financial FCU provides a",
    "cashless system attached to your student\u2019s identification card. We offer this free benefit",
    "to students and their families, as well as faculty and staff. It\u2019s not just a card; it\u2019s also the",
    "link to First Financial\u2019s financial literacy resources. The goal is for all members of our",
    "Calvert Hall community to achieve financial wellness and freedom.",
    "While students are not required to set up an account with First Financial, since Covid-19,",
    "our dining hall is operating cashless. This means, if a student does not have an account",
    "set up with First Financial, they are not able to purchase items for breakfast or lunch in",
    "the dining hall. Of course, students can pack or bring a lunch each day, so an account is",
    "not necessary.",

    "Important Reminders",
    "Students should only buy lunch if they have an account set up with First Financial. Here is some",
    "general information that may help parents and students:",
    "1. All students are issued an ID card and have been given those cards in homeroom. ID",
    "cards are only linked to a First Financial account if you have set one up either online, by",
    "visiting a First Financial branch, or by mailing in paperwork. CARDS ARE NOT",
    "AUTOMATICALLY CREATED WITH AN ACCOUNT. You must set up this account if",
    "you wish to have an account.",
    "2. Once you have applied for an account, the account is not instantly created. Most accounts",
    "take a few days before being activated. Students will need to pack a lunch until they",
    "receive paperwork in the mail from First Financial and know that the account has been",
    "activated.",
    "3. Once an account is active you can put money on the card by downloading the First",
    "Financial app or using the Cardinal Branch at Calvert Hall on school days from 8:00AM",
    "until 8:20AM daily.",
    "4. Students may take an IOU from the Student Activities Office up to three times a semester",
    "if they forgot to put money on their card and need a lunch. However, this is a last resort.",
    "Students should pack a lunch if they are unsure of your account status and call First",
    "Financial to verify account. IOU's are $10 and provide enough money for a Cardinal Meal",
    "Deal. All loans must be repaid within 1 week. Any outstanding loans at the end of each",
    "month will be given to our finance office and will be added to your FACTS account for",
    "payment.",
    "You can reach out to Member Services at 410-321-6060, option 5 or email or call our",
    "representative directly. Mrs Cindy Jones can be reached directly by phone at 410-427-8954",

    "welcome to the Calvert Hall family! As the Student Body President, it is my",
    "responsibility to work with the rest of the Student Council to make this school",
    "year great for both families and students. Each year, the Executive Board of the",
    "Student Council selects a theme to guide our school year. For this upcoming",
    "school year, the Student Council has chosen \u201cTotally Yours,\u201d as our theme. St.",
    "John Baptist De LaSalle, the founder of the Christian Brothers, signed every",
    "letter to his colleagues \u201cTotally Yours\u201d. As students at Calvert Hall, we are",
    "called to live by the mission of LaSalle. LaSalle emphasizes total devotion and",
    "selflessness to ones vocation. This year we will strive to totally devote",
    "ourselves selflessly to our teams, activities, our Brotherhood, and Calvert Hall.",
    "The brotherhood at Calvert Hall is second-to-none! We truly believe",
    "brotherhood is something that each member of our community actively works",
    "towards, and we celebrate the many ways our incoming class will contribute to",
    "our school family. As a first-year Cardinal, we hope that you embrace the call to",
    "join our brotherhood, by using your unique talents to find your place in our",
    "diverse community. This booklet contains all the pertinent information",
    "concerning the opening of school for incoming students. This booklet is your",

    "Calvert Hall Determines Freshman Course Placements Calvert Hall examines",
    "middle school grades and standardized test scores (including the HSPT) as",
    "well as historical performance of students from previous years in order to",
    "determine the appropriate course placements. Students are placed in the most",
    "challenging curriculum that the Offce of Academic Affairs believes will yield a",
    "favorable grade point average via a reasonable amount of hard work. An",
    "admission index is created for each student. It is designed to summarize the",
    "available student data. The index is a combined score compiled of grades,",
    "HSPT, and other standardized scores. The highest index score for the Class of",
    "2028 is 978, with the top 50 scores being 890 or better. The median index score",
    "for the Class of 2028 is a 750. Student index scores can be accessed on the",
    "student profle under contact card. Please review the student\u2019s index score to",
    "better understand course placement on the student profle. Once you have",
    "reviewed your son\u2019s score, please reach out to Mr. Fan, in the Academic Affairs",

    "year. Through a partnership with First Financial Federal Credit Union, the",
    "Student ID card can also function as a Campus Debit Card. The Campus Debit",
    "Card acts as a \u201ccashless\u201d solution for those who wish to make purchases in",
    "our dining hall. The CHC Dining Hall will be cashless for the 2024-2025 school",

    "Of course, students can pack or bring a lunch each day, so an account is not",
    "necessary, but it is convenient. The Campus Debit Card connects to a checking",
    "account at First Financial FCU. Just like an ordinary checking account that",

    "Dear Parents,",
    "We will be continuing to use the Magnus Health Platform for all medical information/forms for the",
    "2024-2025 school year.",
    "Magnus Health integrates with our current system Blackbaud and can be accessed via the",
    "resource tile on the Calvert Hall website, titled Magnus Health. Once logged into your",
    "Magnus account, you will be asked to enter (incoming freshman/transfers) or update",
    "(returning students) your medical information. You will also see a checklist of forms to",
    "complete. Please plan to have your checklist completed and all forms uploaded into the",
    "Magnus Health system by August 1, 2024. Students can not try out for a sport or participate",
    "in Marching Band activities until a current physical has been uploaded and approved in the",
    "Magnus Health system.",
    "Incoming Freshman are required to have Physicals completed (the actual examination, not just",
    "the form completed) between May 31st and August 1st, 2024. Physicals dated prior to May 31st",
    "will not be accepted. Rising sophomores through seniors follow a rolling physical due date. Once",
    "submitted, your son's next physical will be due one year and one day from that date. Throughout",
    "the year, as your son's next physical becomes due, the system will send you regular reminders",
    "as the date approaches. If a new physical is not submitted by the due date, your son will not be",
    "eligible to participate in sports and potentially will not be permitted to attend school.",
    "TO DO:",
    "\u25cf Schedule a Physical",
    "\u25cf Log in to Calvert Hall website and update your parent profile with correct demographic",
    "information, including a cell phone number. Needs to be completed by each parent on",
    "their personal parental account",
    "\u25cf Complete the Emergency Medical Contact information form (on CHC website, once",
    "logged in), will be sent out around July 1st, 2024.",

    "App, click \u201cNew Magnus Health Mobile App\u201d at the top of the page in Magnus. If you",
    "do not have access to a scanner, you may find it easier to upload your forms from the",

    "\u25cf Parental Cell phone numbers are required in order for our staff to reach you in case",
    "of an emergency. Cell phone numbers cannot be updated in Magnus Health. To",
    "enter or update a cell number, please log in to your parental Calvert Hall account on",
