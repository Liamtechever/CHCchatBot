    "INTRODUCTION Our Mission Calvert Hall College, a Lasallian Catholic college ",
    "preparatory school, prepares a diverse community of young men to achieve their ",
    "full potential utilizing their unique talents. Through excellent academic and ",
    "extracurricular programs led by innovative and dedicated educators, our students ",
    "become confident men with the ethical foundation for service, independent ",
    "thinking, and responsible leadership. Inspired by the faith and zeal of St. John ",
    "Baptist de La Salle, our students develop a respect for others as part of an ",
    "inclusive, lifelong Calvert Hall brotherhood as Men of Intellect, Men of Faith, and ",
    "Men of Integrity. The mission statement reflects the following common beliefs held ",
    "by the Calvert Hall community: \u2666 We believe that a value-centered Catholic ",
    "education based on the teachings of Saint John Baptist de La Salle is at the heart ",
    "of Calvert Hall. \u2666 We believe that every student is entitled to an excellent academic ",
    "education. \u2666 We believe that every student needs to be challenged to reach his full ",
    "potential. \u2666 We believe that a college preparatory program provides every student ",
    "with the skills to be a productive member of society. \u2666 We believe that every ",
    "student needs the opportunity to cultivate his God-given gifts and talents. \u2666 We ",
    "believe that a caring community develops the interpersonal relationships that are ",
    "vital to the educational process. \u2666 We believe that the atmosphere of the Calvert ",
    "Hall community promotes a brotherhood that endures beyond graduation. \u2666 We ",
    "believe that Calvert Hall fosters an appreciation for the uniqueness of each person. ",
    "The academic component of Calvert Hall\u2019s mission and beliefs is detailed in this ",
    "Program of Studies. This document contains a complete listing and description of ",
    "Calvert Hall\u2019s course offerings and academic requirements. This Program of ",
    "Studies is an essential reference for the Calvert Hall School community of ",
    "students, parents, guardians, teachers, and counselors regarding all aspects of ",
    "academic affairs, including course selection 4 GRADUATE PROFILE A Man of ",
    "Intellect \u2666 Demonstrates critical & logical thinking skills. \u2666 Exhibits proficiency in ",
    "spoken and written communication. \u2666 Manifests the skills essential for success in ",
    "higher education and life. \u2666 Values the arts, athletics, creativity, and fitness. \u2666 ",
    "Integrates technology for innovative problem solving. \u2666 Embraces the quest for ",
    "knowledge. A Man of Faith \u2666 Understands Catholic moral and social teaching. \u2666 Is ",
    "grounded in core Lasallian values. \u2666 Respects the dignity and uniqueness of ",
    "others. \u2666 Recognizes and values his self-worth. \u2666 Values the sacredness of all life. ",
    "\u2666 Performs meaningful service to the community. \u2666 Is conscious of the presence of ",
    "God in his life. \u2666 Values the brotherhood of the Calvert Hall experience and ",
    "tradition. A Man of Integrity \u2666 Makes sound ethical and moral decisions. \u2666 Acts ",
    "with poise and civility. \u2666 Interacts with others honestly and maturely. \u2666 Accepts ",
    "responsibility for his actions. \u2666 Thinks independently. \u2666 Provides leadership within ",
    "the community. 5 ACADEMIC EXPECTATIONS The dignity and integrity of each ",
    "individual student are essential components of genuine academic success. A ",
    "Calvert Hall College High School diploma should recognize not only the successful ",
    "completion of an academically rigorous course of study but also the formation of a ",
    "young man with high ideals of morality, honesty, and respect for himself and his ",
    "community. Furthermore, Calvert Hall College High School endeavors to create an ",
    "atmosphere of personal and academic freedom and of mutual trust between ",
    "students and faculty. Breaches of academic integrity by a student undermine an ",
    "environment of freedom and trust. A student\u2019s acceptance of enrollment in Calvert ",
    "Hall College High School and continuation of enrollment in Calvert Hall are ",
    "contingent upon the student\u2019s acceptance of and adherence to the principles of ",
    "student responsibility and academic honesty. STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES: \u2022 To ",
    "complete all academic work honestly and independently, except in those instances ",
    "in which an instructor clearly permits collaboration among students, for example, ",
    "assigned group projects. (See \u201cAcademic Violations\u201d) \u2022 To acquaint themselves ",
    "with the meaning of plagiarism, to learn how to properly cite sources used in ",
    "submitted work, and to consult with instructors regarding the allowable resource ",
    "materials or aids to be used during assessments (i.e.: tests) or in the completion of ",
    "any graded work. \u2022 To refrain from revealing any information about an ",
    "assessment's contents, directly or indirectly, to any other student who may later ",
    "take the same assessment. ATTENDENCE: \u2022 Class attendance is essential to a ",
    "student\u2019s academic success. Students should NOT be absent from school unless ",
    "there is a serious reason. If a student needs to be absent, a parent is required to ",
    "sign into the Calvert Hall website and complete the ABSENCE NOTIFICATION ",
    "FORM via the Attendance Tile prior to 9:30am the day of the student\u2019s absence. \u2022 ",
    "The school does NOT approve of the non-academic/vacation absences during the ",
    "academic calendar year. \u2022 Students missing three hours or more of a day will be ",
    "marked \u201cABSENT\u201d. A student may not participate in cocurricular activities on the ",
    "day of an absence. \u2022 Students missing 12 days or more may be required to attend ",
    "academic study hall to compensate for missed instructional time. The Academic ",
    "Study Hall (ASH) takes place both scheduled after-school sessions and on ",
    "scheduled Saturdays. Additionally, a student may need to attend summer school, ",
    "or may be required to withdraw from Calvert Hall resulting from excessive ",
    "absences. \u2022 In instances of absences, the student is responsible for all academic ",
    "work missed due to absences. 6 ACADEMIC VIOLATIONS An academic violation is ",
    "a fraudulent act on the student\u2019s part as outlined in the Student Handbook (pg 15). ",
    "An academic honesty violation will result in a failing grade of a zero (0) for the ",
    "academic work. All academic honesty violations are reported to the Office of ",
    "Academic Affairs (OAA). On any violation, parents or guardians will be notified by ",
    "the reporting instructor and contacted by the OAA. Any ensuing violation requires ",
    "the student, with his parents or guardians, to attend a conference with the Vice ",
    "Principal (OAA). In addition to the policies enumerated above, academic honesty ",
    "violations are subject to disciplinary action which may include suspension or ",
    "expulsion. Additionally, academic honesty violations may affect eligibility or ",
    "standing in the National Honor Society. Instances of Academic Violations can ",
    "include, but are NOT limited to: \u2666 Plagiarizing or copying the academic work of ",
    "another student and submitting it as one\u2019s own \u2666 Plagiarizing or copying or ",
    "allowing another student to copy answers from an assignment, quiz, or test. \u2666 ",
    "Communicating/transmitting answers (verbally or non-verbally) during an ",
    "assessment (i.e.: test or quiz). \u2666 Using notes or other unauthorized materials ",
    "during an assignment, test, or quiz. \u2666 Gaining access to test questions or answers ",
    "before a test without permission of the teacher. \u2666 Violating assignment, quiz, test, ",
    "or assessment procedures established by the teacher. \u2666 Using unauthorized ",
    "resources for take-home assignments without the expressed consent of the ",
    "teacher. \u2666 Obtaining a paper from any source (a person, a text, on-line) and ",
    "submitting as one\u2019s own work. \u2666 Violation of the school\u2019s Artificial Intelligence ",
    "Policy (see below) PLAGIARISM Plagiarism is a situation in which one leads a ",
    "reader to believe that written work submitted by the student is his own writing ",
    "when it is not. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors: \u2666 ",
    "Directly copying part or all of another person\u2019s work and presenting it as your own. ",
    "\u2666 Submission of papers or reports from commercial research companies, including ",
    "on-line sources. \u2666 Copying portions of a text without crediting sources. \u2666 ",
    "Rephrasing another person\u2019s ideas and presenting them as your own without ",
    "crediting sources. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE POLICY INTRODUCTION: Aligned ",
    "with our Lasallian values of forming men of intellect, faith, and integrity, Calvert ",
    "Hall recognizes AI's rapid transformative potential in education, professional life, ",
    "and society. The Calvert Hall community prepares its students for success in a ",
    "modern world, seeks to enhance all aspects of education, and maintains a ",
    "competitive environment for both educators and students. It is recognized that AI ",
    "also presents significant new risks and challenges that must be managed. This ",
    "policy provides guidelines for responsible AI use while maintaining academic ",
    "integrity and critical thinking skills. We affirm the importance of collaboration ",
    "among administration, faculty, and students to ensure AI integration enhances ",
    "learning while reflecting these core values. UNIVERSAL APPLICATION: This policy ",
    "applies to all members of the Calvert Hall community, across all subjects and ",
    "activities. It ensures that the principles of responsible AI use are embedded ",
    "universally within the school's mission, operations and curriculum. Departmental, ",
    "course specific guidelines will address the use of unique AI applications. These ",
    "guidelines will be submitted to and reviewed by the Office of Academic Affairs and ",
    "Technology Committee. 7 POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS: \u2022 Positive Uses: AI ",
    "will be leveraged to personalize learning, provide additional support to students, ",
    "and assist teachers in efficiency with administrative tasks. The benefits of AI in ",
    "improving educational outcomes and efficiency will be emphasized. Examples ",
    "would include AI-powered reading comprehension tools, language learning ",
    "applications, and personalized practice problem generators. \u2022 Negative Uses: The ",
    "policy will address potential risks, such as data privacy concerns, bias in AI ",
    "algorithms, and over-reliance on technology. Clear guidelines will be established ",
    "to mitigate these risks, including regular audits and monitoring of AI systems. ",
    "Audits of AI tool usage patterns will be conducted, including regular privacy ",
    "impact assessments, and student surveys on technology dependence. ",
    "UPHOLDING SCHOOL BELIEFS AND INTEGRITY: \u2022 All AI usage at Calvert Hall will ",
    "align with our core beliefs, including the school\u2019s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), ",
    "and the \"Expectations for Student Conduct\" section included in the Student ",
    "Handbook. \u2022 AI use will be transparent. Students must disclose any AI assistance ",
    "used in their work through proper citation and documentation. Any use of AI for ",
    "academic dishonesty or unethical purposes will be prohibited. Disciplinary actions ",
    "for violations will follow the guidelines provided under Student Handbook ",
    "sections; Academics \u2013 Academic Honesty, and Student Conduct and Discipline. \u2022 ",
    "Course instructors have discretion and authority, using department-wide ",
    "guidelines to determine the proper use of AI for any student produced academic ",
    "work. \u2022 Misuse is to be reported promptly. Academic Expectations, including ",
    "Student Responsibilities, Academic Violations and Plagiarism are detailed in the ",
    "Calvert Hall Program of Studies. Violations can be reported to the Office of ",
    "Academic Affairs, located in the Keelty Hall Front Office. CONCLUSION: By ",
    "adhering to this policy, Calvert Hall aims to integrate AI in a manner that enriches ",
    "our educational environment while maintaining Lasallian orthodoxy. We are ",
    "committed to continuous learning and adaptation to ensure that AI is used ",
    "responsibly and effectively for the benefit of all members of our community. ",
    "Questions and concerns can be submitted to the Director of Technology, a ",
    "permanent member of the CHC AI Task Force. 8 OVERVIEW OF GRADING ",
    "ACADEMIC YEAR: The academic year at Calvert Hall is divided into two semesters. ",
    "GRADE PUBLISHING & MONITORING: Regular online grade postings and ",
    "scheduled Progress Reports offer a snapshot of a student\u2019s academic ",
    "performance at a particular moment during the semester. The Office of Academic ",
    "Affairs issues one Progress Report each semester. A parent or guardian is ",
    "required to electronically verify Progress Reports. SEMESTER REPORT CARD: At ",
    "the end of each semester, the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) issues a Semester ",
    "Report Card. The Semester Report Card in each subject represents the cumulative ",
    "average of all work done throughout the semester including the student\u2019s ",
    "achievement on the semester exam. The first Semester Report Card is issued in ",
    "January and the second Semester Report Card is issued in June. Parents are ",
    "expected to verify electronically their receipt of the Progress Reports and ",
    "Semester 1 Report Card. FINAL GRADE FOR THE YEAR: A student\u2019s final grade for ",
    "a course is determined by taking the average of the grades on the two Semester ",
    "Report Cards except for single semester courses which must be passed ",
    "independently. Faculty members, with approval of the OAA, may override the ",
    "numerical average of the semester grade in determining a final grade. SEMESTER ",
    "EXAMINATIONS: Semester exams are usually given in December and June (in May ",
    "for seniors). Semester exams count for 15% of the overall semester grade. Exams ",
    "are administered in all full credit courses unless otherwise noted. Students must ",
    "take their semester exams on the scheduled day unless illness prevents them from ",
    "attending school. In such cases, the school should be notified via an online ",
    "attendance form, and a doctor\u2019s note is required upon returning to school. ",
    "Students who miss an exam and do not present a doctor\u2019s note for their absence ",
    "may have their exam grade penalized a minimum of 15%. Students taking ",
    "Advanced Placement courses do not take spring semester exams in those ",
    "courses. Senior teachers may exempt individual seniors who have a 90% or higher ",
    "average for their final grade from the final semester exam of a course. ",
    "PROMOTION REQUIREMENTS: To be promoted to the next grade, students are ",
    "required to enroll in six full credit courses and earn a passing grade in each ",
    "course. A passing grade is a final grade of at least 70. All courses at Calvert Hall ",
    "are worth either 1 credit or \u00bd credit. A unit of credit (1) is awarded for the ",
    "completion of a class in which the student has completed all course requirements. ",
    "A half unit of credit (\u00bd) is awarded for the completion of a class (generally with ",
    "less required instructional time) in which the student has completed all course ",
    "requirements. At the end of an academic year, students with fewer than three ",
    "credit failures must remove these failures in an approved summer program to ",
    "return to Calvert Hall in the following academic year. Students with three or more ",
    "credit failures at the end of an academic year must withdraw from Calvert Hall. ",
    "Early or accelerated graduation is not available in the Calvert Hall Program of ",

    "With the approval of the Office of Academic Affairs, the deadline for resolving an ",
    "\u201cIncomplete\u201d may be modified. UNWEIGHTED GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA): A ",

    "CUMULATIVE NUMERIC AVERAGES: Calvert Hall does not rank students ",
    "according to academic performance. In addition to an Unweighted GPA (described ",
    "above), Calvert Hall determines an Unweighted Cumulative Numeric Average and a ",
    "Weighted Cumulative Numeric Average for each student. These are the GPAs that ",
    "consider every semester of a student\u2019s Calvert Hall career. In their calculation, ",
    "Weighted Cumulative Numeric Averages include bonus points that effectively ",
    "reward students for completing Honors and AP classes. HONOR ROLL: The Honor ",
    "Roll status of each student is determined at the end of each semester. Honor Roll ",
    "status is awarded to each student who has achieved a semester GPA of 88 or ",
    "higher with no single course grade below an 81. (Please note that the threshold for ",
    "a semester GPA of 88 is strict. A semester GPA of even 87.999 is NOT rounded up.) ",
    "Each student who makes the Honor Roll is awarded an optional Honor Roll ",
    "Holiday. The Honor Roll Holiday must be taken during the semester immediately ",
    "after the earned Honor Roll status. An Honor Roll Holiday Form is available in the ",
    "Attendance Office and on the Academic Affairs Tile. The form must be signed by ",
    "teachers and parents and then submitted to the Attendance Office TWO days prior ",
    "to the holiday. Parents/guardians will need to call the Attendance Office to verify ",
    "the holiday. Students who fail to follow these procedures may have their Honor ",
    "Roll holiday denied. Students who earn Honor Roll status for both semesters of an ",
    "academic year will receive an Academic Letter the first year and an Academic Star ",
    "for any subsequent year. Academic Letters / Stars are awarded in the Fall of the ",
    "following academic year. HONOR CUP: The Calvert Hall Honor Cup is awarded to ",
    "the graduating senior who has earned the highest weighted GPA for ALL four ",

    "designed for students ready to dedicate themselves to a highly demanding ",
    "workload with challenging and stimulating advanced courses, unique cultural and ",

    "Students engage in accelerated content of Honors and Advanced Placement ",
    "courses, and they are required to take additional courses in Honors Rhetoric and ",
    "Logic, Humanities, and the Honors McMullen Capstone Research Seminar. THE ",
    "BROTHER TOM MILLER HONORS PROGRAM: The Brother Tom Miller Honors ",
    "Program stimulates a student\u2019s love for learning by challenging him with rigorous ",
    "course offerings and developing his whole person with cultural experiences and ",
    "leadership opportunities outside the traditional classroom setting. LA SALLE ",
    "PROGRAM: The La Salle Program serves a group of college-bound students with ",
    "identified language learning difficulties. The program focuses on skills and ",
    "strategies rather than content with the goal of remediating weak reading and ",
    "writing skills while increasing the student\u2019s understanding of his learning ",
    "strengths and needs as he becomes his own advocate. The students are fully ",
    "integrated into the academic program of the school. In addition to their regularly ",
    "scheduled classes, La Salle students have an additional class added to their ",
    "schedule in which they meet individually with their Learning Specialists. The class ",
    "meets one period each day for six times per academic cycle. Consequently, La ",
    "Salle students will have adjustments in their individual schedules to properly ",
    "schedule a full course schedule. ACADEMIC SKILLS PROGRAM (ASP): The ",
    "purpose of the Academic Support Program is to build skills and strategies in ",
    "organization, time management, and study strategies to increase students\u2019 ",
    "independence and success in high school, college, and beyond. Students ",
    "accepted into this program meet with a learning specialist for one period every ",
    "other day for three times per cycle in groups of three to five students. A student in ",
    "this program may have a diagnosed learning difference such as ADHD or ",
    "Executive Function Disorder or may want more instruction to improve in these ",
    "areas. ASP is generally reserved for students in their freshmen and/or sophomore ",
    "year. If a student is in ASP as a junior or senior, the flexibility in his schedule does ",
    "not necessitate any special scheduling rules. LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE: Any ",
    "Calvert Hall student can earn a certificate in leadership at graduation by ",
    "completing three years (sophomore through senior levels) of a program that ",
    "includes leadership seminars, attendance at the Leadership Dinner Speaker ",
    "Series, participation in field trips, two overnight retreat experiences, and courses ",
    "on both the junior and senior levels. A critical piece of this program will include ",
    "participation in clubs and activities as well as the completion of a Leadership ",
    "Practicum experience that will put leadership skills into practice. STEM ",
    "PROGRAM: As an integrated educational and experiential program of academics ",
    "and activities, the STEM Program is designed to encourage students as they ",
    "develop the skills of problem-solving, discovery, and investigative learning. ",
    "Students transfer formal classroom experiences into dynamic and meaningful ",
    "activities outside of the classroom in the practical application of STEM in the 21st ",
    "century. 13 NATIONAL HONOR SOCIETY - SELECTION CRITERIA Membership in ",

    "ENROLLMENT Calvert Hall offers a Dual Enrollment Program through Notre Dame ",
    "University of Maryland (NDMU) for students who are seeking more rigorous course ",
    "work to strengthen their academic profile. Students who successfully complete ",
    "Dual Enrollment courses will earn credit from NDMU, which can be submitted to ",
    "the college of their choice. The college retains the discretion to accept or not ",
    "accept transferred credit. NDMU DUAL ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS \u2022 Dual ",
    "Enrollment participation must be approved by the Office of Academic Affairs and ",
    "is for current students only and cannot be applied retroactively. \u2022 Students must be ",
    "in good academic standing (3.00 unweighted GPA or higher) at registration. \u2022 ",
    "Students must be at least 16 years or older at the start of the Dual Enrollment ",
    "course. \u2022 Students must have a recommendation from a school counselor. \u2022 CHC ",
    "pre-approved courses are released each Fall once approved by the Academic Dean ",
    "of NDMU. These courses will be included on the CHC transcript and calculated into ",
    "a student\u2019s GPA. ENRICHMENT COURSES Calvert Hall encourages students to ",
    "enroll in enrichment courses at their own discretion. Students should enroll in ",
    "courses to reflect their interests. The approved courses for credit will NOT be ",
    "calculated toward a student\u2019s overall GPA nor included on their CHC transcript. ",
    "CHC recommends enrichment course offered by Catholic Virtual. The current ",
    "catalogue of academic offerings can be found HERE Additionally, Calvert Hall does ",
    "offer courses for summer enrichment that can earn original credit courses. Each ",
    "course has received prior approval from OAA as original credit. Enrollment in ",
    "approved summer enrichment courses DOES NOT permit a student to accelerate ",
    "graduation and students are still expected to enroll in six full credit courses in the ",
    "following academic year. In cases of low student enrollment, a summer course ",
    "may close. Each summer\u2019s original credit course will include a course fee. The ",
    "Course selection Tile displays information about approved summer courses for ",
    "original credit for the upcoming Academic Year: FIELD TRIP INFORMATION The ",
    "Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) believes that a student\u2019s education can extend ",
    "beyond the traditional classroom setting. Field trips are a valuable experience that ",
    "can enrich a student\u2019s academic experience. All field trips will need the approval of ",
    "the OAA and should be scheduled to present the smallest interruption to the ",
    "academic calendar and the student\u2019s instructional time. The general timeline for ",
    "field trips are between Oct and the end of April. Fields trips will not be allowed ",
    "during December, May, or June because of the consideration of Semester Exams. ",
    "All field trips are considered optional endeavors and therefore students do have ",
    "the choice of \u201copting out\u201d of any field trip experience without course penalty. In ",
    "such cases, students must be present for the school day and attend all classes as ",
    "scheduled. The teacher of the course may issue alternative work for students who ",
    "choose to \u201copt out\u201d of the field trip in lieu of attending. 15 COURSE ",
    "SELECTION/PLACEMENT PROCESS AND TIMELINE The course placement ",
    "process is an integral part of the student\u2019s schedule creation. It requires care, ",
    "discussion, and commitment from the student, his parents, and the school. ",
    "Utilizing input from the student, his current teachers, his school counselors and ",
    "when needed, the Office of Academic Affairs, the objective is to create a student ",
    "schedule that provides the highest level of academic rigor and offers the student ",
    "an opportunity for success. After final approval, a student\u2019s schedule will not be ",
    "adjusted unless there is a serious educational reason. As a rule, \u201cwhat a student ",
    "chooses in the course placement process in spring Semester, is what the student ",
    "will take in the following semester.\u201d A student\u2019s course level placement need not ",
    "be permanent for his entire Calvert Hall career. Students who wish to move up a ",
    "level in a subject will need high performing academic achievement and their ",
    "current course teacher\u2019s recommendation. Typically, students will not be allowed ",
    "to have level changes in more than THREE courses in a single academic year. The ",
    "Office of Academic Affairs will have the final say in any course movement for a ",
    "student. The following timeline is a guide to the course placement process. All ",
    "course placements are subject to final review and approval by the Office of ",
    "Academic Affairs. Course placements may be adjusted to accommodate the proper ",
    "scheduling of a student\u2019s courseload. \u2022 MID-FEBRUARY: o Course ",

    "course is college preparatory in nature. Every course is either \u00bd Credit or 1 Credit. ",
    "Over an academic year, a \u00bd Credit course typically meets less often than a 1 Credit ",
    "course. Two \u00bd Credit courses cannot be combined to replace a 1 credit course ",
    "requirement. Each academic course is classified according to one of four ",
    "academic classifications. In order of increasing academic rigor, they are the ",
    "following: COLLEGE PREP B LEVEL: These courses are designed with ",
    "skill-building in mind. Increased attention is given to writing skills, reading skills, ",
    "and study skills. The speed of each course varies, but the workload tends to be ",
    "stable. Instructors will cover all essential topics in alignment with College Prep A ",
    "courses. The prerequisite for enrollment in College Prep B courses is a current ",
    "teacher recommendation. COLLEGE PREP A LEVEL: These courses are designed ",
    "to challenge students who have adequately mastered skills. Sustained academic ",
    "performance and satisfactory standardized testing results are used to support ",
    "placement. The prerequisite for enrollment in College Prep A courses is a current ",
    "teacher recommendation. HONORS LEVEL: These courses are designed to ",
    "challenge students who have demonstrated excellence in academic performance ",
    "and standardized testing results. These courses were designed for students who ",
    "can navigate an increased workload. Tests, assignments, class discussions, and ",
    "other assessments are crafted to help Honors Level students prepare for eventual ",
    "AP Level consideration. The prerequisites for enrollment in Honors Level courses ",
    "include current teacher recommendation and department approval. AP LEVEL: ",
    "Students enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP) Level courses have demonstrated ",
    "the highest level of academic performance and standardized test results. Students ",
    "enrolled in AP Level courses must register for and complete the official AP Exam ",
    "associated with the course. There is a fee for the AP Exam. The prerequisites for ",
    "enrollment in AP Level courses include current teacher recommendation and ",
    "department approval. ACADEMIC ACCOMODATIONS Calvert Hall students are ",
    "legally eligible to receive a variety of academic accommodations. Calvert Hall will ",
    "extend classroom accommodation within the reasonable capacity of our ",
    "resources. To receive academic accommodation, a request for accommodation will ",
    "be registered with School Counseling. The student will then need to be ",
    "professionally evaluated and diagnosed with a learning disability. The current list ",
    "of accommodation afforded to qualified students includes Preferential Seating, ",
    "Extended Testing Time, Test administration in a designated testing center, no ",
    "penalty for in-class spelling errors, note-taking/lecture support, use of assistive ",
    "electronic device as needed. Additional unspecified accommodation can be issued ",
    "on a limited basis in consultation with the School Counseling department and the ",
    "Office of Academic Affairs. For the steps to be considered regarding ",
    "accommodations, please contact the student\u2019s school counselor. 17 COURSE ",
    "DESCRIPTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR FRESHMEN, SOPHOMORE, JUNIOR, ",
    "AND SENIOR YEARS The pages that follow contain a detailed description of the ",
    "courses available and required for each academic grade level. Included will be ",
    "Program exceptions and credits needed for grade promotion. When reviewing the ",
    "course descriptions, students should take note of any prerequisites necessary for ",
    "each course. Students should read each course description carefully and consider ",
    "meeting with a course teacher or Department Chair to have a better understanding ",
    "of the course requirements. In general, all courses need a recommendation by the ",
    "student\u2019s current teacher. All AP courses need a current teacher\u2019s ",
    "recommendation and Department approval. Department approval is by the ",
    "Department Chair or the teacher of the AP course. Some courses will require a ",
    "minimum grade as part of the requirement for enrollment. Students taking an AP ",
    "course are required to take the AP exam. Failure to do so can prevent enrollment ",
    "in future AP courses. 18 FRESHMEN YEAR - COURSES AND REQUIREMENTS ",

    "encounter the living Word of God, Jesus Christ. In the course they will learn about ",
    "the Bible, authored by God through Inspiration, and its value to people throughout ",
    "the world. If they have not been taught this earlier, they will learn how to read the ",
    "Bible and will become familiar with the major sections of the Bible and the books ",
    "included in each section, with a particular focus on the Hebrew Scriptures as an ",
    "overview and introduction to salvation history. Additional topics include ",

    "Jesus and Morality (College Prep A) Grade 10 The purpose of this course is to help ",
    "students understand all that God has done for us through his Son, Jesus Christ. ",
    "Through this course of study, students will learn that for all eternity, God has ",
    "planned for us to share eternal happiness with him, which is accomplished ",
    "through the redemption Christ won for us. Students will learn that they share in ",
    "this redemption only in and through Jesus Christ. They will also be introduced to ",
    "what it means to be a disciple of Christ. The second semester will study the ways ",
    "people integrate personal morality into the settings in which they find themselves. ",
    "It will challenge them to examine the relationship they see between their own faith ",
    "and the call to morality and justice presented by the events of daily living. ",

    "church was founded through the Apostles and is sustained through the Holy ",
    "Spirit. The Church will be described as the living Body of Christ today. Further, the ",
    "students will explore the way Christ can be encountered through each of the ",
    "individual Sacraments. In the spring semester, the course will introduce students ",
    "to the richness of the Church\u2019s social teaching through an exploration of the 7 ",
    "Principles of Catholic Social Teaching, and how they are called to care for the poor ",

    "Religions/Suffering, Evil & Death (College Prep A) Grade 12 In the first semester, ",
    "students will explore how the Catholic Church recognizes and values the ",

    "Students will be introduced to the nature and philosophy of the worldviews of ",
    "various religious traditions, namely those of Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and ",
    "Islam. The student will explore the elements of each religion and how human ",
    "persons have experienced the sacred and sought to comprehend the mystery of ",
    "life. Attention will be given to various rituals and traditions associated with each ",
    "religion with a comparative evaluation of how each understands the unique roles ",
    "of the divine, human nature, and our shared search for meaning. In the second ",
    "semester, students will be challenged to dig into their faith by exploring the ",
    "systematic, scriptural, and pastoral responses to suffering and the problem of evil ",
    "from various perspectives. Theologians, philosophers, and others have reflected ",
    "deeply on the subject and will be utilized heavily in the course. Since people often ",

    "INTRODUCTION Our Mission Calvert Hall College, a Lasallian Catholic college ",
    "preparatory school, prepares a diverse community of young men to achieve their full ",
    "potential utilizing their unique talents. Through excellent academic and extracurricular ",
    "programs led by innovative and dedicated educators, our students become confident ",
    "men with the ethical foundation for service, independent thinking, and responsible ",
    "leadership. Inspired by the faith and zeal of St. John Baptist de La Salle, our students ",
    "develop a respect for others as part of an inclusive, lifelong Calvert Hall brotherhood ",
    "as Men of Intellect, Men of Faith, and Men of Integrity. The mission statement reflects ",
    "the following common beliefs held by the Calvert Hall community: \u2666 We believe that a ",
    "value-centered Catholic education based on the teachings of Saint John Baptist de ",
    "La Salle is at the heart of Calvert Hall. \u2666 We believe that every student is entitled to ",
    "an excellent academic education. \u2666 We believe that every student needs to be ",
    "challenged to reach his full potential. \u2666 We believe that a college preparatory ",
    "program provides every student with the skills to be a productive member of society. ",
    "\u2666 We believe that every student needs the opportunity to cultivate his God-given gifts ",
    "and talents. \u2666 We believe that a caring community develops the interpersonal ",
    "relationships that are vital to the educational process. \u2666 We believe that the ",
    "atmosphere of the Calvert Hall community promotes a brotherhood that endures ",
    "beyond graduation. \u2666 We believe that Calvert Hall fosters an appreciation for the ",
    "uniqueness of each person. The academic component of Calvert Hall\u2019s mission and ",
    "beliefs is detailed in this Program of Studies. This document contains a complete ",
    "listing and description of Calvert Hall\u2019s course offerings and academic requirements. ",
    "This Program of Studies is an essential reference for the Calvert Hall School ",
    "community of students, parents, guardians, teachers, and counselors regarding all ",
    "aspects of academic affairs, including course selection. 4 GRADUATE PROFILE A ",
    "Man of Intellect \u2666 Demonstrates critical & logical thinking skills. \u2666 Exhibits proficiency ",
    "in spoken and written communication. \u2666 Manifests the skills essential for success in ",
    "higher education and life. \u2666 Values the arts, athletics, creativity, and fitness. \u2666 ",
    "Integrates technology for innovative problem solving. \u2666 Embraces the quest for ",
    "knowledge. A Man of Faith \u2666 Understands Catholic moral and social teaching. \u2666 Is ",
    "grounded in core Lasallian values. \u2666 Respects the dignity and uniqueness of others. ",
    "\u2666 Recognizes and values his self-worth. \u2666 Values the sacredness of all life. \u2666 ",
    "Performs meaningful service to the community. \u2666 Is conscious of the presence of ",
    "God in his life. \u2666 Values the brotherhood of the Calvert Hall experience and tradition. ",

    "civility. \u2666 Interacts with others honestly and maturely. \u2666 Accepts responsibility for his ",

    "ACADEMIC EXPECTATIONS The dignity and integrity of each individual student are ",
    "essential components of genuine academic success. A Calvert Hall College High ",
    "School diploma should recognize not only the successful completion of an ",
    "academically rigorous course of study but also the formation of a young man with ",
    "high ideals of morality, honesty, and respect for himself and his community. ",
    "Furthermore, Calvert Hall College High School endeavors to create an atmosphere of ",
    "personal and academic freedom and of mutual trust between students and faculty. ",
    "Breaches of academic integrity by a student undermine an environment of freedom ",
    "and trust. A student\u2019s acceptance of enrollment in Calvert Hall College High School ",
    "and continuation of enrollment in Calvert Hall are contingent upon the student\u2019s ",
    "acceptance of and adherence to the principles of student responsibility and academic ",
    "honesty. STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES  To complete all academic work honestly ",
    "and independently, except in those instances in which an instructor clearly permits ",
    "collaboration among students, for example, assigned group projects. (See \u201cAcademic ",
    "Cheating\u201d)  To acquaint themselves with the meaning of plagiarism, to learn how to ",
    "properly cite sources used in submitted work, and to consult with instructors ",
    "regarding the allowable resource materials or aids to be used during assessments ",
    "(i.e.: tests) or in the completion of any graded work.  To refrain from revealing any ",
    "information about an assessment's contents, directly or indirectly, to any other ",
    "student who may later take the same assessment. ATTENDENCE:  Class attendance ",
    "is essential to a student\u2019s academic success. Students should NOT be absent from ",
    "school unless there is a serious reason. If a student needs to be absent, a parent is ",
    "required to sign into the Calvert Hall website and complete the ABSENCE ",
    "NOTIFICATION FORM via the Attendance Tile prior to 9:30am the day of the ",
    "student\u2019s absence.  The school does NOT approve of the non-academic/vacation ",
    "absences.  Students missing three hours or more of a day will be marked absent. A ",
    "student may not participate in cocurricular activities on the day of an absence.  ",
    "Students missing 12 days or more will be required to attend after-school/Saturday ",
    "academic sessions, attend summer school, or be required to withdraw from Calvert ",
    "Hall.  In instances of absences, the student is responsible for all academic work ",
    "missed due to absences. ACADEMIC VIOLATIONS An academic violation is a ",
    "fraudulent act on the student\u2019s part. It includes, but is NOT limited to: \u2666 Copying ",
    "answers from another student\u2019s assignment, quiz, or test. \u2666 Allowing another student ",
    "to copy answers from an assignment, quiz, or test. \u2666 Communicating/transmitting ",
    "answers (verbally or non-verbally) during an assessment (i.e.: test or quiz). \u2666 Using ",
    "notes or other unauthorized materials during an assignment, test, or quiz. \u2666 Gaining ",
    "access to test questions or answers before a test without permission of the teacher. \u2666 ",
    "Violating assignment, quiz, test, or assessment procedures established by the ",
    "teacher. \u2666 Copying the work of another student and submitting it as one\u2019s own. 6 \u2666 ",
    "Collaborating with others or with written materials in take-home assignments unless ",
    "expressly allowed to do so by the teacher. \u2666 Obtaining a paper from any source (a ",
    "person, a text, on-line) and submitting it to a teacher as one\u2019s own work. ",
    "PLAGIARISM Plagiarism is a situation in which one leads a reader to believe that ",
    "written work submitted by the student is his own writing when it is not. Plagiarism ",
    "includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors: \u2666 Directly copying part or all of ",
    "another person\u2019s work and presenting it as your own. \u2666 Submission of papers or ",
    "reports from commercial research companies, including on-line sources. \u2666 Copying ",
    "portions of a text without crediting sources. \u2666 Rephrasing another person\u2019s ideas and ",
    "presenting them as your own without crediting sources. An academic honesty ",
    "violation will result in a failing grade of a zero (0) for the academic work. All academic ",
    "honesty violations are reported to the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA). On any ",
    "violation, parents or guardians will be notified by the reporting instructor and ",
    "contacted by the OAA. Any ensuing violation requires the student, with his parents or ",
    "guardians, to attend a conference with the Assistant Principal for Academic Affairs. In ",
    "addition to the policies enumerated above, academic honesty violations are subject ",
    "to disciplinary action which may include suspension or expulsion. Additionally, ",
    "academic honesty violations may affect eligibility or standing in the National Honor ",
    "Society. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE USAGE POLICY As a school, Calvert Hall ",
    "recognizes the growing importance of technology in education and the increasing ",
    "role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in student learning and within our educational ",
    "environment. Use of these tools must align and be consistent with our principles of ",
    "academic honesty and the Acceptable Use policy for Technology. This policy outlines ",
    "the expectations of responsible student usage of AI in all academic work. Any ",
    "student's use of AI without prior course teacher approval will be considered a ",
    "violation of academic honesty. Consequently, any AI related violation will be subject ",
    "to the school Academic Honesty policy as outlined in the Student Handbook (Page ",
    "15) and reported to the Office of Academic Affairs. Student must ensure that any ",
    "work produced using AI tools reflects the student\u2019s own understanding and learning ",
    "of the material. Plagiarism in any form is strictly prohibited and includes the ",
    "copying/usage of AI-generated content without prior teacher approval and therefore ",
    "proper attribution/citation per course policy. 7 OVERVIEW OF GRADING ACADEMIC ",
    "YEAR: The academic year at Calvert Hall is divided into two semesters. GRADE ",
    "MONITORING: daily, students and parents may monitor grades online. Additionally, ",
    "the Office of Academic Affairs issues one Progress Report each semester. A parent ",
    "or guardian is required to electronically verify Progress Reports. Day-to-day grade ",
    "postings and Progress Reports offer a snapshot of a student\u2019s academic ",
    "performance at a particular moment during the semester. SEMESTER REPORT ",
    "CARD: At the end of each semester, the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) issues a ",
    "Semester Report Card. The Semester Report Card in each subject represents the ",
    "cumulative average of all work done throughout the semester including the student\u2019s ",

    "consider every semester of a student\u2019s Calvert Hall career. In their calculation, ",
    "Weighted Cumulative Numeric Averages include bonus points that effectively reward ",
    "students for completing Honors and AP classes. HONOR ROLL: The Honor Roll ",
    "status of each student is determined at the end of each semester. Honor Roll status ",
    "is awarded to each student who has achieved a semester GPA of 88 or higher with ",
    "no single course grade below an 81. (Please note that the threshold for a semester ",
    "GPA of 88 is strict. A semester GPA of even 87.999 is NOT rounded up.) Each ",
    "student who makes the Honor Roll is awarded an optional Honor Roll Holiday. The ",
    "Honor Roll Holiday must be taken during the semester immediately after the earned ",
    "Honor Roll status. An Honor Roll Holiday Form is available in the Attendance Office ",

    "and then submitted to the Attendance Office TWO days prior to the holiday. ",
    "Parents/guardians will need to call the Attendance Office to verify the holiday. ",
    "Students who fail to follow these procedures may have their Honor Roll holiday ",
    "denied. Students who earn Honor Roll status for both semesters of an academic year ",

    "earn credit from NDMU, which can be submitted to the college of their choice. The ",
    "college retains the discretion to accept or not accept transferred credit. NDMU Dual ",
    "Enrollment Requirements  Dual Enrollment participation must be approved by the ",
    "Office of Academic Affairs and is for current students only and cannot be applied ",
    "retroactively.  Students must be in good academic standing (3.00 unweighted GPA or ",
    "higher) at registration.  Students must be at least 16 years or older at the start of the ",
    "Dual Enrollment course.  Students must have a recommendation from a school ",

    "students to enroll in enrichment courses at their own discretion. Students should ",
    "enroll in courses to reflect their interests. The approved courses for credit will NOT ",
    "be calculated toward a student\u2019s overall GPA nor included on their CHC transcript. ",
    "CHC recommends enrichment course offered by Catholic Virtual. The current ",
    "catalogue of academic offerings can be found HERE Additionally, Calvert Hall does ",
    "offer courses for summer enrichment that can earn original credit courses. Each ",
    "course has received prior approval from OAA as original credit. Enrollment in ",
    "approved summer enrichment courses DOES NOT permit a student to accelerate ",
    "graduation and students are still expected to enroll in six full credit courses in the ",
    "following academic year. In cases of low student enrollment, a summer course may ",
    "close. Each summer original credit course will include a course fee. The Course ",
    "selection Tile displays information about approved summer courses for original credit ",
    "for the upcoming Academic Year: FIELD TRIP INFORMATION The Office of ",
    "Academic Affairs (OAA) believes that a student\u2019s education can extend beyond the ",
    "traditional classroom setting. Field trips are a valuable experience that can enrich a ",
    "student\u2019s academic experience. All field trips will need approval of the OAA and ",
    "should be scheduled to present the smallest interruption to the academic calendar ",
    "and the student\u2019s instructional time. The general timeline for field trips are between ",
    "Oct and the end of April. Fields trips will not be allowed during December, May, or ",
    "June because of the consideration of Semester Exams. All field trips are considered ",
    "optional endeavors and therefore students do have the choice of \u201copting out\u201d of any ",
    "field trip experience without course penalty. In such cases, students must be present ",
    "for the school day and attend all classes as scheduled. The teacher of the course ",
    "may issue alternative work for students who choose to \u201copt out\u201d of the field trip in lieu ",
    "of attending. 14 COURSE SELECTION/PLACEMENT PROCESS AND TIMELINE ",
    "The course placement process is an integral part of the student\u2019s schedule creation. ",
    "It requires care, discussion, and commitment from the student, his parents, and the ",
    "school. Utilizing input from the student, his current teachers, his school counselors ",
    "and when needed, the Office of Academic Affairs, the objective is to create a student ",
    "schedule that provides the highest level of academic rigor and offers the student an ",
    "opportunity for success. After final approval, a student\u2019s schedule will not be adjusted ",
    "unless there is a serious educational reason. As a rule, \u201cwhat a student chooses in ",
    "the course placement process in spring Semester, is what the student will take in the ",
    "following semester.\u201d A student\u2019s course level placement need not be permanent for ",
    "his entire Calvert Hall career. Students who wish to move up a level in a subject will ",
    "need high performing academic achievement and their current course teacher\u2019s ",
    "recommendation. Typically, students will not be allowed to have level changes in ",
    "more than THREE courses in a single academic year. The Office of Academic Affairs ",
    "will have the final say in any course movement for a student. The following timeline is ",
    "a guide to the course placement process. All course placements are subject to final ",
    "review and approval by the Office of Academic Affairs. Course placements may be ",

    "Calvert Hall, every course is college preparatory in nature. Every course is either \u00bd ",
    "Credit or 1 Credit. Over an academic year, a \u00bd Credit course typically meets less ",
    "often than a 1 Credit course. Two \u00bd Credit courses cannot be combined to replace a ",
    "1 credit course requirement. Each academic course is classified according to one of ",
    "four academic classifications. In order of increasing academic rigor, they are the ",
    "following: COLLEGE PREP B LEVEL: These courses are designed with skill-building ",
    "in mind. Increased attention is given to writing skills, reading skills, and study skills. ",
    "The speed of each course varies, but the workload tends to be stable. Instructors will ",

    "for enrollment in College Prep B courses is a current teacher recommendation. ",
    "COLLEGE PREP A LEVEL: These courses are designed to challenge students who ",
    "have adequately mastered skills. Sustained academic performance and satisfactory ",

    "enrollment in College Prep A courses is a current teacher recommendation. ",
    "HONORS LEVEL: These courses are designed to challenge students who have ",
    "demonstrated excellence in academic performance and standardized testing results. ",

    "recommendation and department approval. AP LEVEL: Students enrolled in ",
    "Advanced Placement (AP) Level courses have demonstrated the highest level of ",
    "academic performance and standardized test results. Students enrolled in AP Level ",
    "courses must register for and complete the official AP Exam associated with the ",
    "course. There is a fee for the AP Exam. The prerequisites for enrollment in AP Level ",
    "courses include current teacher recommendation and department approval. ",
    "ACADEMIC ACCOMODATIONS Calvert Hall students are legally eligible to receive a ",
    "variety of academic accommodations. Calvert Hall will extend classroom ",
    "accommodation within the reasonable capacity of our resources. To receive ",

    "description carefully and consider meeting with a course teacher or Department ",
    "Chair to have a better understanding of the course requirements. In general, all ",
    "courses need a recommendation by the student\u2019s current teacher. All AP courses ",
    "need a current teacher\u2019s recommendation and Department approval. Department ",
    "approval is by the Department Chair or the teacher of the AP course. Some courses ",
    "will require a minimum grade as part of the requirement for enrollment. Students ",
    "taking an AP course are required to take the AP exam. Failure to do so can prevent ",
    "enrollment in future AP courses. 17 FRESHMEN YEAR - COURSES AND ",
