An academic honesty violation will result in a failing grade of a zero (0) for the academic work. All academic honesty violations are reported to the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA). On any violation, parents or guardians will be notified by the reporting instructor and contacted by the OAA. Any ensuing violation requires the student, with his parents or guardians, to attend a conference with the Vice Principal (OAA). In addition to the policies enumerated above, academic honesty violations are subject to disciplinary action which may include suspension or expulsion. Additionally, academic honesty violations may affect eligibility or standing in the National Honor Society.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE POLICY INTRODUCTION: Aligned with our Lasallian values of forming men of intellect, faith, and integrity, Calvert Hall recognizes AI's rapid transformative potential in education, professional life, and society. The Calvert Hall community prepares its students for success in a modern world, seeks to enhance all aspects of education, and maintains a competitive environment for both educators and students. It is recognized that AI also presents significant new risks and challenges that must be managed. This policy provides guidelines for responsible AI use while maintaining academic integrity and critical thinking skills. We affirm the importance of collaboration among administration, faculty, and students to ensure AI integration enhances learning while reflecting these core values. UNIVERSAL APPLICATION: This policy applies to all members of the Calvert Hall community, across all subjects and activities. It ensures that the principles of responsible AI use are embedded universally within the school's mission, operations and curriculum. Departmental, course specific guidelines will address the use of unique AI applications. These guidelines will be submitted to and reviewed by the Office of Academic Affairs and Technology Committee. 7 POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS: • Positive Uses: AI will be leveraged to personalize learning, provide additional support to students, and assist teachers in efficiency with administrative tasks. The benefits of AI in improving educational outcomes and efficiency will be emphasized. Examples would include AI-powered reading comprehension tools, language learning applications, and personalized practice problem generators.", "metadata": {"section": null, "subsection": "Resources", "chunk": 8}}
{"id": "b7b15c6e-2498-4957-90c0-c939cf9882f8", "text": "• Negative Uses: The policy will address potential risks, such as data privacy concerns, bias in AI algorithms, and over-reliance on technology. Clear guidelines will be established to mitigate these risks, including regular audits and monitoring of AI systems. Audits of AI tool usage patterns will be conducted, including regular privacy impact assessments, and student surveys on technology dependence. UPHOLDING SCHOOL BELIEFS AND INTEGRITY: • All AI usage at Calvert Hall will align with our core beliefs, including the school's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and the \"Expectations for Student Conduct\" section included in the Student Handbook. • AI use will be transparent. Students must disclose any AI assistance used in their work through proper citation and documentation. Any use of AI for academic dishonesty or unethical purposes will be prohibited. Disciplinary actions for violations will follow the guidelines provided under Student Handbook sections; Academics – Academic Honesty, and Student Conduct and Discipline. • Course instructors have discretion and authority, using department-wide guidelines to determine the proper use of AI for any student produced academic work. • Misuse is to be reported promptly. Academic Expectations, including Student Responsibilities, Academic Violations and Plagiarism are detailed in the Calvert Hall Program of Studies. Violations can be reported to the Office of Academic Affairs, located in the Keelty Hall Front Office. CONCLUSION: By adhering to this policy, Calvert Hall aims to integrate AI in a manner that enriches our educational environment while maintaining Lasallian orthodoxy. We are committed to continuous learning and adaptation to ensure that AI is used responsibly and effectively for the benefit of all members of our community. Questions and concerns can be submitted to the Director of Technology, a permanent member of the CHC AI Task Force. 8 OVERVIEW OF GRADING ACADEMIC YEAR: The academic year at Calvert Hall is divided into two semesters.", "metadata": {"section": null, "subsection": "Resources", "chunk": 9}}

The Office of Academic Affairs issues one Progress Report each semester. A parent or guardian is required to electronically verify Progress Reports. SEMESTER REPORT CARD: At the end of each semester, the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) issues a Semester Report Card. The Semester Report Card in each subject represents the cumulative average of all work done throughout the semester including the student's achievement on the semester exam. The first Semester Report Card is issued in January and the second Semester Report Card is issued in June. Parents are expected to verify electronically their receipt of the Progress Reports and Semester 1 Report Card. FINAL GRADE FOR THE YEAR: A student's final grade for a course is determined by taking the average of the grades on the two Semester Report Cards except for single semester courses which must be passed independently. Faculty members, with approval of the OAA, may override the numerical average of the semester grade in determining a final grade. SEMESTER EXAMINATIONS: Semester exams are usually given in December and June (in May for seniors). Semester exams count for 15% of the overall semester grade. Exams are administered in all full credit courses unless otherwise noted. Students must take their semester exams on the scheduled day unless illness prevents them from attending school. In such cases, the school should be notified via an online attendance form, and a doctor's note is required upon returning to school. Students who miss an exam and do not present a doctor's note for their absence may have their exam grade penalized a minimum of 15%. Students taking Advanced Placement courses do not take spring semester exams in those courses.

The program focuses on skills and strategies rather than content with the goal of remediating weak reading and writing skills while increasing the student's understanding of his learning strengths and needs as he becomes his own advocate. The students are fully integrated into the academic program of the school. In addition to their regularly scheduled classes, La Salle students have an additional class added to their schedule in which they meet individually with their Learning Specialists. The class meets one period each day for six times per academic cycle. Consequently, La Salle students will have adjustments in their individual schedules to properly schedule a full course schedule. ACADEMIC SKILLS PROGRAM (ASP): The purpose of the Academic Support Program is to build skills and strategies in organization, time management, and study strategies to increase students' independence and success in high school, college, and beyond. Students accepted into this program meet with a learning specialist for one period every other day for three times per cycle in groups of three to five students. A student in this program may have a diagnosed learning difference such as ADHD or Executive Function Disorder or may want more instruction to improve in these areas.

In addition, a student must have at least eight hours of approved community service completed during their sophomore or junior year. CHARACTER AND LEADERSHIP: A student must demonstrate positive leadership qualities in the classroom and in school activities. Candidates will be required to complete an essay on leadership. Also, candidates are required to demonstrate exemplary character by not having any record of discipline for a serious offense, such as those listed in the Discipline Policies section of the Student Handbook and Regulations, having no more than one violation of a school rule per year, and by receiving positive teacher evaluations. 14 DUAL ENROLLMENT Calvert Hall offers a Dual Enrollment Program through Notre Dame University of Maryland (NDMU) for students who are seeking more rigorous course work to strengthen their academic profile. Students who successfully complete Dual Enrollment courses will earn credit from NDMU, which can be submitted to the college of their choice. The college retains the discretion to accept or not accept transferred credit. NDMU DUAL ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS • Dual Enrollment participation must be approved by the Office of Academic Affairs and is for current students only and cannot be applied retroactively.", "metadata": {"section": "85.99 B 3.0 – 3.39 81 – 82.99 B- 2.8 – 2.99 78 – 80.99 C+ 2.4 – 2.79 75 – 77.99 C 2.0 –", "subsection": "Religion: 4 Credits Required Mathematics: 3 Credits Required Laboratory Science", "chunk": 3}}

These courses will be included on the CHC transcript and calculated into a student's GPA. ENRICHMENT COURSES Calvert Hall encourages students to enroll in enrichment courses at their own discretion. Students should enroll in courses to reflect their interests. The approved courses for credit will NOT be calculated toward a student's overall GPA nor included on their CHC transcript. CHC recommends enrichment course offered by Catholic Virtual. The current catalogue of academic offerings can be found HERE Additionally, Calvert Hall does offer courses for summer enrichment that can earn original credit courses. Each course has received prior approval from OAA as original credit. Enrollment in approved summer enrichment courses DOES NOT permit a student to accelerate graduation and students are still expected to enroll in six full credit courses in the following academic year. In cases of low student enrollment, a summer course may close. Each summer's original credit course will include a course fee. The Course selection Tile displays information about approved summer courses for original credit for the upcoming Academic Year: FIELD TRIP INFORMATION The Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) believes that a student's education can extend beyond the traditional classroom setting. Field trips are a valuable experience that can enrich a student's academic experience. All field trips will need the approval of the OAA and should be scheduled to present the smallest interruption to the academic calendar and the student's instructional time. The general timeline for field trips are between Oct and the end of April. Fields trips will not be allowed during December, May, or June because of the consideration of Semester Exams.", "metadata": {"section": "85.99 B 3.0 – 3.39 81 – 82.99 B- 2.8 – 2.99 78 – 80.99 C+ 2.4 – 2.79 75 – 77.99 C 2.0 –", "subsection": "Religion: 4 Credits Required Mathematics: 3 Credits Required Laboratory Science", "chunk": 4}}

In such cases, students must be present for the school day and attend all classes as scheduled. The teacher of the course may issue alternative work for students who choose to \"opt out\" of the field trip in lieu of attending. 15 COURSE SELECTION/PLACEMENT PROCESS AND TIMELINE The course placement process is an integral part of the student's schedule creation. It requires care, discussion, and commitment from the student, his parents, and the school. Utilizing input from the student, his current teachers, his school counselors and when needed, the Office of Academic Affairs, the objective is to create a student schedule that provides the highest level of academic rigor and offers the student an opportunity for success. After final approval, a student's schedule will not be adjusted unless there is a serious educational reason. As a rule, \"what a student chooses in the course placement process in spring Semester, is what the student will take in the following semester.\" A student's course level placement need not be permanent for his entire Calvert Hall career. Students who wish to move up a level in a subject will need high performing academic achievement and their current course teacher's recommendation. Typically, students will not be allowed to have level changes in more than THREE courses in a single academic year. The Office of Academic Affairs will have the final say in any course movement for a student. The following timeline is a guide to the course placement process. All course placements are subject to final review and approval by the Office of Academic Affairs. Course placements may be adjusted to accommodate the proper scheduling of a student's courseload. • MID-FEBRUARY: o Course recommendations by a student's current teachers • MID-FEBRUARY TO MARCH: o Review of teacher recommendations by student, parents, guardians in conjunction with student's school counselor.", "metadata": {"section": "85.99 B 3.0 – 3.39 81 – 82.99 B- 2.8 – 2.99 78 – 80.99 C+ 2.4 – 2.79 75 – 77.99 C 2.0 –", "subsection": "Religion: 4 Credits Required Mathematics: 3 Credits Required Laboratory Science", "chunk": 5}}

Every course is either ½ Credit or 1 Credit. Over an academic year, a ½ Credit course typically meets less often than a 1 Credit course. Two ½ Credit courses cannot be combined to replace a 1 credit course requirement. Each academic course is classified according to one of four academic classifications. In order of increasing academic rigor, they are the following: COLLEGE PREP B LEVEL: These courses are designed with skill-building in mind. Increased attention is given to writing skills, reading skills, and study skills. The speed of each course varies, but the workload tends to be stable. Instructors will cover all essential topics in alignment with College Prep A courses. The prerequisite for enrollment in College Prep B courses is a current teacher recommendation.

Inspired by the faith and zeal of St. John Baptist de La Salle, our students develop a respect for others as part of an inclusive, lifelong Calvert Hall brotherhood as Men of Intellect, Men of Faith, and Men of Integrity. The mission statement reflects the following common beliefs held by the Calvert Hall community: ♦ We believe that a value-centered Catholic education based on the teachings of Saint John Baptist de La Salle is at the heart of Calvert Hall. ♦ We believe that every student is entitled to an excellent academic education. ♦ We believe that every student needs to be challenged to reach his full potential. ♦ We believe that a college preparatory program provides every student with the skills to be a productive member of society. ♦ We believe that every student needs the opportunity to cultivate his God-given gifts and talents. ♦ We believe that a caring community develops the interpersonal relationships that are vital to the educational process. ♦ We believe that the atmosphere of the Calvert Hall community promotes a brotherhood that endures beyond graduation. ♦ We believe that Calvert Hall fosters an appreciation for the uniqueness of each person. The academic component of Calvert Hall's mission and beliefs is detailed in this Program of Studies. This document contains a complete listing and description of Calvert Hall's course offerings and academic requirements. This Program of Studies is an essential reference for the Calvert Hall School community of students, parents, guardians, teachers, and counselors regarding all aspects of academic affairs, including course selection. 4 GRADUATE PROFILE A Man of Intellect ♦ Demonstrates critical & logical thinking skills. ♦ Exhibits proficiency in spoken and written communication. ♦ Manifests the skills essential for success in higher education and life.", "metadata": {"section": "Courses For Junior Year*** Junior Year - Courses And Requirements", "subsection": "at each ASH session The upcoming schedule for Tues & Thurs ASH this year will be", "chunk": 5}}

A Calvert Hall College High School diploma should recognize not only the successful completion of an academically rigorous course of study but also the formation of a young man with high ideals of morality, honesty, and respect for himself and his community. Furthermore, Calvert Hall College High School endeavors to create an atmosphere of personal and academic freedom and of mutual trust between students and faculty. Breaches of academic integrity by a student undermine an environment of freedom and trust. A student's acceptance of enrollment in Calvert Hall College High School and continuation of enrollment in Calvert Hall are contingent upon the student's acceptance of and adherence to the principles of student responsibility and academic honesty. STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES To complete all academic work honestly and independently, except in those instances in which an instructor clearly permits collaboration among students, for example, assigned group projects.", "metadata": {"section": "Courses For Junior Year*** Junior Year - Courses And Requirements", "subsection": "at each ASH session The upcoming schedule for Tues & Thurs ASH this year will be", "chunk": 6}}

To refrain from revealing any information about an assessment's contents, directly or indirectly, to any other student who may later take the same assessment. ATTENDENCE: Class attendance is essential to a student's academic success. Students should NOT be absent from school unless there is a serious reason. If a student needs to be absent, a parent is required to sign into the Calvert Hall website and complete the ABSENCE NOTIFICATION FORM via the Attendance Tile prior to 9:30am the day of the student's absence. The school does NOT approve of the non-academic/vacation absences. Students missing three hours or more of a day will be marked absent. A student may not participate in cocurricular activities on the day of an absence. Students missing 12 days or more will be required to attend after-school/Saturday academic sessions, attend summer school, or be required to withdraw from Calvert Hall. In instances of absences, the student is responsible for all academic work missed due to absences. ACADEMIC VIOLATIONS An academic violation is a fraudulent act on the student's part. It includes, but is NOT limited to: ♦ Copying answers from another student's assignment, quiz, or test. ♦ Allowing another student to copy answers from an assignment, quiz, or test. ♦ Communicating/transmitting answers (verbally or non-verbally) during an assessment (i.e.: test or quiz). ♦ Using notes or other unauthorized materials during an assignment, test, or quiz. ♦ Gaining access to test questions or answers before a test without permission of the teacher.", "metadata": {"section": "Courses For Junior Year*** Junior Year - Courses And Requirements", "subsection": "at each ASH session The upcoming schedule for Tues & Thurs ASH this year will be", "chunk": 7}}

PLAGIARISM Plagiarism is a situation in which one leads a reader to believe that written work submitted by the student is his own writing when it is not. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors: ♦ Directly copying part or all of another person's work and presenting it as your own. ♦ Submission of papers or reports from commercial research companies, including on-line sources. ♦ Copying portions of a text without crediting sources. ♦ Rephrasing another person's ideas and presenting them as your own without crediting sources. An academic honesty violation will result in a failing grade of a zero (0) for the academic work. All academic honesty violations are reported to the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA). On any violation, parents or guardians will be notified by the reporting instructor and contacted by the OAA. Any ensuing violation requires the student, with his parents or guardians, to attend a conference with the Assistant Principal for Academic Affairs. In addition to the policies enumerated above, academic honesty violations are subject to disciplinary action which may include suspension or expulsion. Additionally, academic honesty violations may affect eligibility or standing in the National Honor Society. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE USAGE POLICY As a school, Calvert Hall recognizes the growing importance of technology in education and the increasing role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in student learning and within our educational environment.", "metadata": {"section": "Courses For Junior Year*** Junior Year - Courses And Requirements", "subsection": "at each ASH session The upcoming schedule for Tues & Thurs ASH this year will be", "chunk": 8}}

This policy outlines the expectations of responsible student usage of AI in all academic work. Any student's use of AI without prior course teacher approval will be considered a violation of academic honesty. Consequently, any AI related violation will be subject to the school Academic Honesty policy as outlined in the Student Handbook (Page 15) and reported to the Office of Academic Affairs. Student must ensure that any work produced using AI tools reflects the student's own understanding and learning of the material. Plagiarism in any form is strictly prohibited and includes the copying/usage of AI-generated content without prior teacher approval and therefore proper attribution/citation per course policy. 7 OVERVIEW OF GRADING ACADEMIC YEAR: The academic year at Calvert Hall is divided into two semesters. GRADE MONITORING: daily, students and parents may monitor grades online. Additionally, the Office of Academic Affairs issues one Progress Report each semester. A parent or guardian is required to electronically verify Progress Reports. Day-to-day grade postings and Progress Reports offer a snapshot of a student's academic performance at a particular moment during the semester. SEMESTER REPORT CARD: At the end of each semester, the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA) issues a Semester Report Card. The Semester Report Card in each subject represents the cumulative average of all work done throughout the semester including the student's achievement on the semester exam. The first Semester Report Card is issued in January and the second Semester Report Card is issued in June. Parents are expected to verify electronically their receipt of the Progress Reports and Semester 1 Report Card. FINAL GRADE FOR THE YEAR: A student's final grade for a course is determined by taking the average of the grades on the two Semester Report Cards except for single semester courses which must be passed independently.

Exams are administered in all full credit courses unless otherwise noted. Students must take their semester exams on the scheduled day unless illness prevents them from attending school. In such cases, the school should be notified via an online attendance form, and a doctor's note is required upon returning to school. Students who miss an exam and do not present a doctor's note for their absence will have their exam grade penalized a minimum of 15%. Students taking Advanced Placement courses do not take spring semester exams in those courses. Senior teachers may exempt individual seniors who have a 90% or higher average for their final grade from the final semester exam of a course. PROMOTION REQUIREMENTS: To be promoted to the next grade, students are required to enroll in six full credit courses and earn a passing grade in each course. A passing grade is a final grade of at least 70. All courses at Calvert Hall are worth either 1 credit or ½ credit. A unit of credit (1) is awarded for the completion of a class in which the student has completed all course requirements. A half unit of credit (½) is awarded for the completion of a class (generally with less required instructional time) in which the student has completed all course requirements. At the end of an academic year, students with fewer than three credit failures must remove these failures in an approved summer program to return to Calvert Hall in the following academic year. Students with three or more credit failures at the end of an academic year must withdraw from Calvert Hall. Early or accelerated graduation is not available in the Calvert Hall Program of Study. 8 MARKING SYSTEM Numerical Range Letter Grade G.P.A.", "metadata": {"section": "Courses For Junior Year*** Junior Year - Courses And Requirements", "subsection": "semester grade in determining a final grade.

The highly competitive McMullen Scholars Program involves an integrated program of study. Students engage in accelerated content of Honors and Advanced Placement courses, and they are required to take additional courses in Honors Rhetoric and Logic, Humanities, and the Honors McMullen Capstone Research Seminar. THE BROTHER TOM MILLER HONORS PROGRAM: The Brother Tom Miller Honors Program stimulates a student's love for learning by challenging him with rigorous course offerings and developing his whole person with cultural experiences and leadership opportunities outside the traditional classroom setting. LA SALLE PROGRAM: The La Salle Program serves a group of college-bound students with identified language learning difficulties. The program focuses on skills and strategies rather than content with the goal of remediating weak reading and writing skills while increasing the student's understanding of his learning strengths and needs as he becomes his own advocate. The students are fully integrated into the academic program of the school. In addition to their regularly scheduled classes, La Salle students have an additional class added to their schedule in which they meet individually with their Learning Specialists. The class meets one period each day for six times per academic cycle. Consequently, La Salle students will have adjustments in their individual schedules to properly schedule a full course schedule (See the course requirements for each class year to review potential adjustments) ACADEMIC SKILLS PROGRAM (ASP): The purpose of the Academic Support Program is to build skills and strategies in organization, time management, and study strategies to increase students' independence and success in high school, college, and beyond. Students accepted into this program meet with a learning specialist for one period every other day for three times per cycle in groups of three to five students.", "metadata": {"section": "Distinguished Academic Programs The Mcmullen Scholars", "subsection": null, "chunk": 0}}

Field trips are a valuable experience that can enrich a student's academic experience. All field trips will need approval of the OAA and should be scheduled to present the smallest interruption to the academic calendar and the student's instructional time. The general timeline for field trips are between Oct and the end of April. Fields trips will not be allowed during December, May, or June because of the consideration of Semester Exams. All field trips are considered optional endeavors and therefore students do have the choice of \"opting out\" of any field trip experience without course penalty. In such cases, students must be present for the school day and attend all classes as scheduled. The teacher of the course may issue alternative work for students who choose to \"opt out\" of the field trip in lieu of attending. 14 COURSE SELECTION/PLACEMENT PROCESS AND TIMELINE The course placement process is an integral part of the student's schedule creation.

As a rule, \"what a student chooses in the course placement process in spring Semester, is what the student will take in the following semester.\" A student's course level placement need not be permanent for his entire Calvert Hall career.

Every course is either ½ Credit or 1 Credit. Over an academic year, a ½ Credit course typically meets less often than a 1 Credit course. Two ½ Credit courses cannot be combined to replace a 1 credit course requirement. Each academic course is classified according to one of four academic classifications.

They are a society of religious men having for their objective the personal sanctification of its members through the Christian education of youth. John Baptist de La Salle, a young French priest, was the founder of the Brothers. Early in his priesthood, de La Salle became concerned about the lack of educational opportunities for poor and working class boys, and he resolved to help them. He opened his first school in 1679 in the city of Rheims to provide boys with a \"human and Christian education.\" De La Salle died in 1719, and in 1725 the Brothers of the Christian Schools were formally approved by the Church. He was proclaimed a saint by the Church in 1900. Today, over 2,800 Brothers and their associates are engaged in the mission of Christian education in over 78 countries worldwide. Lasallian education came to the United States in 1845 with the opening of a school for boys at Calvert Hall on Saratoga Street in Baltimore. The school, located in the Cathedal Parish (Basilica of the Assumption), was under the direction of Brother Francis McMullen, a native Baltimorean. One hundred pupils in that first class began a tradition that would eventually enrich the lives of many thousands of young men in the city of Baltimore and its surrounding counties. In 1890, limited space in the original building necessitated its relocation to a larger facility at Cathedral and Mulberry Streets. Decades of success as a college preparatory school, with country school pre-secondary programs and athletic facilities at Walbrook Oval, gave the \"Old Hall\" an enviable reputation. Continuous growth through the first half of the twentieth century would once again prompt the Brothers to search for a new location.", "metadata": {"section": ".................................................................................................. 56 About Calvert Hall", "subsection": null, "chunk": 0}}

Subsequent development of the thirty-three acre campus included the construction of the pool building in 1967 (now Carlo Crispino Center), the Marion Burk Knott Center for the Performing Arts in 1989, Paul Angelo Russo Stadium in 1999, George Young Hall in 2004, Carlo Crispino Stadium in 2008, the John G. Noppinger Jr. '64 Student Commons in 2015, the John G. Noppinger Jr. '64 Greenhouse in 2018, the Military Tribute Monument in 2019, new turf practice fields in 2021, and a new E-Sports & Cybersecurity Arena in 2024. The breadth and strength of Calvert Hall's scholastic and extracurricular programs are reflected in its having twice been cited as an \"Exemplary School\" by the United States Department of Education. At the core of this success as a Lasallian school is an experienced 2 and dedicated staff who strive to put into practice the school motto, vitae via virtus, virtue is a way of life. Their dedication as educators who focus on the uniqueness of each student helps them to form leaders with a Christian perspective who will have a positive influence on the future. St. John Baptist de La Salle envisioned the Christian school as a place where the spirit of faith and an awareness of the presence of God were at the core of the educational process.

The faculty holds students to high standards of intellectual and moral development, encouraging them to reach their potential and preparing them to face the challenges of the modern world. Essential elements of Lasallian educational practice are teaching and learning in community. The Brothers and their lay colleagues, \"together and by association,\" foster an educational atmosphere where the expertise of each staff member is valued. Instructed by St. John Baptist de La Salle to act as brothers to one another and to the young men entrusted to their care, the Christian Brothers have shared this educational approach with lay associates at Calvert Hall. The faculty and staff model a community that promotes a brotherhood enduring beyond graduation. The school remains faithful to its commitments as an institution of the Roman Catholic 3 Church.

Visiting Schools On days when classes are dismissed early, or on holidays when other schools are in session, students are not permitted to visit other schools without prior authorization from an administrator of the other school. 14 ACADEMICS Academic Honesty Education begins with a dialogue between student and teacher, the basis of which is an honest and truthful exchange of knowledge. In order for a teacher to respond fully and accurately to what a student knows and can do, all academic work submitted by students, whether an assignment, a test, a paper, or a lab report, must be their own work and reflect their own understanding. Anyone assisting students should be particularly careful in this regard. Student submissions should not reflect the work of others and, as warranted, should include attribution from the internet or other sources. Students' work must reflect their own efforts. Students must cite work when using another person's ideas, language, or facts. Students who have questions about their academic work should consult with their course teacher especially on assignments where student collaboration is allowed. Examples of cheating include giving or receiving information during a test, quiz, and/or class work assignment without teacher authorization; using unauthorized materials for academic work, including electronic devices to store or transmit information; copying homework; and getting questions and/or answers from a student who has already taken the test.", "metadata": {"section": ".................................................................................................. 56 About Calvert Hall", "subsection": "the Lost and Found, which belong to others, is considered theft.

With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools within our educational environment, use of these tools must align and be consistent with our Academic Honesty Policy and the Acceptable Use policy for Technology. Submitted work that is unauthorized or uncited is considered a violation of our policies. An academic honesty violation will result in a failing grade on academic work of a zero. All academic honesty violations are reported to the Assistant Principal for Academic Affairs. On a first violation, an academic violation will result in a failing grade of \"0\" for the academic work. The violation will be reported by the instructor to Office of Academic Affairs (Assistant Principal) and the student's parents/guardians. The student will be expected to attend a conference with the Assistant Principal to review the Academic Violation. A subsequent violation requires the parents/guardians and student to attend a conference with the Assistant Principal for Academic Affairs to review his academic standing. In addition to the policies enumerated above, academic violations are subject to academic disciplinary action which may include but are not limited to disciplinary referrals, academic suspensions or academic expulsion. 15 Academic Probation A student with two or more credit failures at the end of the first semester or as a final grade will be placed on Academic Probation.

Addressing Academic Concerns Inevitably, questions and issues arise during the school year that parents may need to have answered and resolved.

For academic matters that need further discussion, parents may wish to communicate directly with the subject teacher first and then the Department Chair. Please do not contact teachers/counselors or other members of the staff at home in the evening or on weekends.

To that end, students are responsible for the manner in which they represent themselves and Calvert Hall at all times. A student who brings discredit to himself and the school through public misconduct will be subject to disciplinary action when the matter is brought to the attention of the school administration.

While we understand that reporting on fellow students' behavior can be difficult, we need everyone's help in ensuring that our school is a safe place. Even if a student believes that the administration is aware of an issue, that student should still report what they know.

As in all matters involving student conduct, Calvert Hall reserves the right to suspend or expel any student whose behavior is, in the School's judgment, a threat to the well-being and safety of the School community, whether or not it violates a specifically stated rule. Disciplinary Policies General Detention: A student may be assigned to this detention for any behavior that violates school regulations, for other disciplinary problems referred to the Dean of Students, or for being late to class or school. General detention begins five minutes after dismissal and is held for forty minutes. If a student is late for detention he will receive an additional day, unless he presents a note from the teacher who detained him. No student may be excused from general detention except by the Dean of Students. Accumulated detentions (5) will result in a student being assigned to Saturday detention 9:00 a.m. - noon. Students receiving numerous detentions may be ineligible to participate in or attend school activities. 23 Private Detention: A private detention is issued when a student has violated a teacher's policies. A student is then to report to the teacher at the indicated time and place. If a student also has General Detention at that time, he should ask the teacher for a note to be given to the Dean of Students indicating the reason for his lateness to or absence from General Detention.

In the event that a student violates a school regulation that involves suspension or the possibility of dismissal from school the following procedures are followed. n Suspension: Parents are notified of a suspension by the Dean of Students and an appointment is scheduled for them to come to school to discuss the situation. A parent must sign a letter acknowledging the suspension and its disciplinary consequences. His/her son cannot be re-admitted to class if this is not done in a timely manner. A student who is suspended may, at the discretion of the Dean of Students/Discipline Committee, be ineligible to participate in or attend school activities, such as athletics or senior prom. A student receiving a second suspension during the course of his four years may be subject to expulsion.

Services offered by the department are designed to assist students as they meet challenges. Each student is assigned a school counselor for his four years, and they meet at least once a semester (in addition to individually scheduled appointments). School counseling sessions may be individual or in groups, and will involve discussion of educational and career goals in high school and beyond. School counselors may provide referrals to professionally trained individuals and services outside of school. School counselors work closely with faculty and parents while monitoring academic progress. Conferences can be scheduled at any time and parents/guardians are invited to contact their son's counselor at any time. The School Counseling Department administers the Christopher O'Neil Peer Education Program. This program provides an opportunity for junior and senior peer educators to serve as big brothers to the freshmen by teaching effective life skills that will lead to safe, positive decisions. College counselors support students and families through the college admission process by teaching college advising classes, individual student and parent meetings along with group presentations for parents. Various aspects of the college admission process are highlighted including admissions, standardized testing, financial aid, athletic recruitment, and transitioning to life after high school. The department's programming includes the following events: October Testing Day, Fall College Fair, and several informational college planning meetings for parents of Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors. The School Counseling Department is authorized to release students' transcripts to college/ university admissions departments, NCAA coaches, and scholarship granting organizations unless advised in writing to the contrary by a student's parent or legal guardian. Transcript requests should be directed to student's college counselor. 37 Accommodations: Consistent with its policy prohibiting discrimination, Calvert Hall is committed to ensuring that students with disabilities are provided with equal access to its programs.", "metadata": {"section": "1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2019.

School-wide masses, Lenten/Advent and team prayer opportunities, service trips and projects, food and clothing drives, music ministry and peer ministry are all coordinated through the Campus Ministry Office. Chapel: Calvert Hall has placed its Chapel under the protection of Our Lady of the Star. Masses every first Friday of the month, daily communion services, and other liturgical opportunities are celebrated regularly in this sacred space. Students are encouraged to participate whenever their schedule permits. Teachers are likewise encouraged to bring their classes to the chapel periodically in order to emphasize our connectedness with the Lord. Liturgy and Prayer: The liturgical and prayer lives of our students are a key component to our Campus Ministry Program. The school community gathers several times throughout the year on special occasions and holy days of obligation for Mass. Students are involved in all aspects of liturgy from lectors, to Eucharistic Ministers, to music ministers, to ushers and technology aides.

The Ambassador's Club is a volunteer group of Calvert Hall students who assist the Admissions team by attending presentations, hosting prospective students on their \"Cardinal for a Day\" experience and serving as tour guides at Open House. Additionally, the Admissions Homeroom interacts with 8th grade guests and their families during their \"Cardinal for a Day\" experience. The members of their homeroom also take part in several other admissions events throughout the year. The school leadership also appreciates the important role Calvert Hall alumni and parents play in the overall recruitment process. Many prospective students and parents have indicated that their interest was the direct result of what they heard our graduates and parents say about their experiences. We are grateful for this support and encourage all members of the Calvert Hall community to continue referring interested students and their families to our Admissions Office. Students applying to Calvert Hall are required to take the Archdiocesan High School Placement Test in December, submit an online Calvert Hall Application, and have their middle school grades and records forwarded to the Admissions Office.", "metadata": {"section": "1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2019.

It's not just a card; it's also the link to First Financial's financial literacy resources. The goal is for all members of our Calvert Hall community to achieve financial wellness and freedom. While students are not required to set up an account with First Financial, since Covid-19, our dining hall is operating cashless.

On behalf of the entire student body, welcome to the Calvert Hall family! As the Student Body President, it is my responsibility to work with the rest of the Student Council to make this school year great for both families and students. Each year, the Executive Board of the Student Council selects a theme to guide our school year. For this upcoming school year, the Student Council has chosen \"Totally Yours,\" as our theme. St. John Baptist De LaSalle, the founder of the Christian Brothers, signed every letter to his colleagues \"Totally Yours\". As students at Calvert Hall, we are called to live by the mission of LaSalle. LaSalle emphasizes total devotion and selflessness to ones vocation. This year we will strive to totally devote ourselves selflessly to our teams, activities, our Brotherhood, and Calvert Hall. The brotherhood at Calvert Hall is second-to-none! We truly believe brotherhood is something that each member of our community actively works towards, and we celebrate the many ways our incoming class will contribute to our school family. As a first-year Cardinal, we hope that you embrace the call to join our brotherhood, by using your unique talents to find your place in our diverse community. This booklet contains all the pertinent information concerning the opening of school for incoming students. This booklet is your go-to manual on how to enter CHC successfully.

Section 2 6 How Calvert Hall Determines Freshman Course Placements Calvert Hall examines middle school grades and standardized test scores (including the HSPT) as well as historical performance of students from previous years in order to determine the appropriate course placements. Students are placed in the most challenging curriculum that the Offce of Academic Affairs believes will yield a favorable grade point average via a reasonable amount of hard work. An admission index is created for each student. It is designed to summarize the available student data. The index is a combined score compiled of grades, HSPT, and other standardized scores. The highest index score for the Class of 2028 is 978, with the top 50 scores being 890 or better. The median index score for the Class of 2028 is a 750. Student index scores can be accessed on the student profle under contact card. Please review the student's index score to better understand course placement on the student profle. Once you have reviewed your son's score, please reach out to Mr. Fan, in the Academic Affairs Offce, with any questions.

All students receive an ID card at the start of the school year. Through a partnership with First Financial Federal Credit Union, the Student ID card can also function as a Campus Debit Card. The Campus Debit Card acts as a \"cashless\" solution for those who wish to make purchases in our dining hall. The CHC Dining Hall will be cashless for the 2024-2025 school year. A student must have an account set up with First Financial in order to purchase items in the dining hall. Students are not required to set up an account with First Financial, however our dining hall is set up to be cashless. Of course, students can pack or bring a lunch each day, so an account is not necessary, but it is convenient. The Campus Debit Card connects to a checking account at First Financial FCU. Just like an ordinary checking account that uses a debit card, purchases made with the Campus Card draw on the available funds in the checking account. As an added bonus to parents, the Campus Debit Card works on campus only; however, you will receive a separate Visa Debit Card for use off campus. Calvert Hall and First Financial FCU have partnered to provide this program as well as the building blocks to fnancial wellness and freedom for your families. Signing up for an account is easy!

Please do not hesitate to reach out to our technology department with any questions at 410-825-4266 ext 189. Once the school year begins, students who experience any technology issues can stop into the library (on the plaza level of George Young Hall) for technology assistance. Please note that one of the most frequent laptop issues occurs when a student does not properly charge his device. Students will need to be responsible for keeping their device charged and using the charging station in the dining hall or library when necessary. CHC recommends each student purchase an additional power cord for their device. Having an additional power cord available at school, in addition to one at home, will allow for a student to not have to bring one back and forth to school.", "metadata": {"section": "Registrations You Might Need Later", "subsection": "Wereyou able to apply for your sons account online? 15 SECTION #5", "chunk": 0}}

RETREAT – CLASS OF 2028 FRESHMAN RETREAT Each year, the Campus Ministry Offce at Calvert Hall provides opportunities for students to develop their relationship with God, celebrate Christian community, and share their gifts and talents with the larger community through service and outreach. These goals are accomplished through retreats, service opportunities, liturgies, charitable drives, prayer services and other aspects fundamental to the faith and spiritual foundation of the school. Tentatively scheduled for October 17th–18th, the Class of 2028 will take part in their frst retreat. This retreat will be a great opportunity for the freshmen to form community with one another and with the many student and faculty volunteers who will be helping to coordinate the retreat. Over the course of the two days, freshmen will bond in peer-led small groups as they explore what it means to be Lasallian. By focusing on the Lasallian themes of faith, service, and community, freshmen will participate in team-building games and competitions, refect on how to build a strong community within and beyond Calvert Hall, pray together, and share their experience of faith with others in our community.", "metadata": {"section": "They Are Not Participating In Our Freshman Connection Program.", "subsection": "school's professional staff.

Attendance Form Links (Parent Access Only) Dear Parents, We will be continuing to use the Magnus Health Platform for all medical information/forms for the 2024-2025 school year. Magnus Health integrates with our current system Blackbaud and can be accessed via the resource tile on the Calvert Hall website, titled Magnus Health. Once logged into your Magnus account, you will be asked to enter (incoming freshman/transfers) or update (returning students) your medical information. You will also see a checklist of forms to complete. Please plan to have your checklist completed and all forms uploaded into the Magnus Health system by August 1, 2024. Students can not try out for a sport or participate in Marching Band activities until a current physical has been uploaded and approved in the Magnus Health system. Incoming Freshman are required to have Physicals completed (the actual examination, not just the form completed) between May 31st and August 1st, 2024. Physicals dated prior to May 31st will not be accepted. Rising sophomores through seniors follow a rolling physical due date. Once submitted, your son's next physical will be due one year and one day from that date.
